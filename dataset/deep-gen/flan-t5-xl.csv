"So, do you kinda want to duel wield insane weapons and kill mass amounts of Nazi's? Then this is the game for you.  You start out brain dead for 14 years in a nut house only to wake up for the first time and kill a Nazi within seconds of doing so (guess no muscle atrophy occurred, but it makes sense due to your deep voice).  From there you sneak into the capitol of the most Nazi infested city to search for the Nazi resistence blindly, find them and kill mass amounts of Nazis. Then you break into prison only to save a friend and break out killing more mass amounts of Nazis. Then you volunteer yourself into slave labor only to find a dude and then break out (killing mass amounts of Nazis of course). Then, what the heck, you go to their secret moon base to kill mass amounts of more Nazis... returning to Earth to, well, kill mass amounts of more Nazis.  The game ends a little abruptly leaving you to think you probably died in an epic and somewhat frustrating boss fight, but I have a hunch that you'll return in an upcoming DLC or sequel to kill mass amounts of more Nazis.  * For fans of Return to Wolfenstein it is important to note that this game includes none of the occult or undead content - everything is replaced by crazy robotic stuff and half man half machine creeps.",1,kinda want duel wield insane weapons kill mass amounts nazis game start brain dead years nut house wake first time kill nazi within seconds guess muscle atrophy occurred makes sense due deep voice sneak capitol nazi infested city search nazi resistence blindly find kill mass amounts nazis break prison save friend break killing mass amounts nazis volunteer slave labor find dude break killing mass amounts nazis course heck go secret moon base kill mass amounts nazis returning earth well kill mass amounts nazis game ends little abruptly leaving think probably died epic somewhat frustrating boss fight hunch youll return upcoming dlc sequel kill mass amounts nazis fans return wolfenstein important note game includes none occult undead content everything replaced crazy robotic stuff half man half machine creeps,"Nazi Germany, and then you get to play the game for a few years.

One of my favourite game of all time! I highly recommend playing with friends and playing expert mode (if you're up for the challenge). The game still has smaller and bigger (free!) updates that add to the already great experience. Also there is quite a high replay value since there are many different items and playstyles (a complete playthrough at least once a year is a must for me and my friends)!  In my opinion it is a must-have for every Steam-library.,1,one favourite game time highly recommend playing friends playing expert mode youre challenge game still smaller bigger free updates add already great experience also quite high replay value since many different items playstyles complete playthrough least year must friends opinion musthave every steamlibrary,a lot of new features and content.

"Have you ever wanted to be a detective who has to solve some of the most insane cases of murder, arson, robbery and much more? Then this game is for you! The idea for a game when you have to read peoples faces to tell if they are lying or not is ingenious. The motion capture for this game is unreal, and at the same time, makes the game challenging. Some people will give off easily that they are lying, but others, you can't be too sure. Besides all of the detective work, this game looks somewhat like grand theft auto, but in the 1940s. You can drive around town in older cars, as well as take them, as in grand theft auto. Very cool game nonetheless, and would recommend it.",1,ever wanted detective solve insane cases murder arson robbery much game idea game read peoples faces tell lying ingenious motion capture game unreal time makes game challenging people give easily lying others cant sure besides detective work game looks somewhat like grand theft auto drive around town older cars well take grand theft auto cool game nonetheless would recommend,Cases are based on real life events and the player has to solve them.

"I was a bit hasty in my original review for this game. Once I reduced the punishing difficulty, I found the game to be quite rewarding. Flying around, collecting new weapons and buying bigger ships is a lot of fun. This game reminds me a lot of Starfleet Command, and I reccomend this to fans of that game, especially if you wished there was more to do in those games then just combat. Like actually docking at stations, mining minerals for profit. Capturing ships and having said capture actually benifit you.  if you are sceptical about this game, I have read lots of good things about its sequal. you could look there instead.  ***Original Review***  I read many of the reviews for this game but still thought that it would be a good game for myself anyway. At first, it did show promice. A 'Starfleet Command' like game for the modern era. Sadly I found the game to be a bit punishing at its normal dificulty.  I still think the premice is good, and I with it's sequal in Early Acsess as of this review (and hopefully the game is being molded by the community because of that), I do hope that the 2nd game is better then the 1st.

"What a sequel. What a game.  Alice: Madness Returns, is quite easily, my favourite game of all time. Featuring perhaps one of the most twisted and dark storylines set in the disgustingly beautiful world of Wonderland. The game features perhaps one of the most interesting, stunningly crafted main characters I've ever played - she's certainly my favourite character of all time. Perhaps the only negative aspect of Madness Returns, is the silly inclusion of puzzles and somewhat repetitive minigames. However, these are not anywhere close to annoying enough to actually affect the game's overall experience, yet act more as slightly stupid speed bumps.   9/10",1,sequel game alice madness returns quite easily favourite game time featuring perhaps one twisted dark storylines set disgustingly beautiful world wonderland game features perhaps one interesting stunningly crafted main characters ive ever played shes certainly favourite character time perhaps negative aspect madness returns silly inclusion puzzles somewhat repetitive minigames however anywhere close annoying enough actually affect games overall experience yet act slightly stupid speed bumps,Alice has ever seen.

"Released several years ago, Defense Grid was one of the first big indie hits on Steam as well as one of the greatest tower defense games of all time. A game that is easy to learn, and difficult to master, it starts out pretty simple and limiting at first, but by the later levels, there are many options to how you set up your route, what weapons to use, and how you use them. The game also boosts some solid visuals, a suprisingly interesting story and main character, and good replayability on all but the initial few tutorial-like missions.

"As a fan of the original games I found Enemy Unknown and the expansion Enemy Withing very fun and enjoyable. There are a few similarities with the games such as both being turn based and the aliens being the same for the most part but that is where the similarities end. Unlike the original there is not as easy to keep all the nations happy and you are bound to lose a nation or two before you can think about ending the alien threat. Also unlike the original you can only make one base, meaning you have to pick and chose what you research and manufacture more carefully. In combat you start off with a small group of four and can upgrade to six and though that number seems small it forces you to play smarter and using the skills for your units more than in the orignal. With all games with RNG you can get into some critical situations and either hit an enemy when you only had a 10% or feel you heart sink as your best sniper misses the life saving shot though he had a 95% chance to hit. Those who think this game is too easy are also in luck as there is a mod called the Long War mod which makes the game that much harder and more fun.

"Good, but needs a lot of improvements and changes in my opinion. There's a lot of things that don't make sense and spawns can sometimes ruin the fun. Often, if you get caught up with too many enemies, you might as well take a break, because everytime you die, you're usually spawned with them. Would make sense if the game spawned you in a completed stucture/house when you died or somewhere relatively safe. And that's just getting started at the beginning.  Personally, I've never expereinced anything that is shown in the videos. That is not to say it's not possible, but I think what they show you is rather advanced level stuff--the game, for the most part, doesn't seem to have near that much action or excitement when you're just getting started. I imagine you'd have to be playing for a really long time, within the same world, to experience any of that.  I do recommend the game though. It's pretty solid even though I've been experiencing some random slow down and cannot figure out what to do about it. Turning down graphics (not the issue), frame skipping, window mode/fullscreen, updating XNA... nothing seems to fix the issue. I don't recall it being an issue before, so it may have come with an update for all I know.  None of this is indicative of what you may experience, so take it all with a grain of salt.",1,good needs lot improvements changes opinion theres lot things dont make sense spawns sometimes ruin fun often get caught many enemies might well take break everytime die youre usually spawned would make sense game spawned completed stucturehouse died somewhere relatively safe thats getting started beginning personally ive never expereinced anything shown videos say possible think show rather advanced level stuffthe game part doesnt seem near much action excitement youre getting started imagine youd playing really long time within world experience recommend game though pretty solid even though ive experiencing random slow cannot figure turning graphics issue frame skipping window modefullscreen updating xna nothing seems fix issue dont recall issue may come update know none indicative may experience take grain salt,I'm spawned in the middle of the map and I'm not able to get out of it.

"Where to even begin.. Wolfenstein: The New Order is phenomenal. I kept delaying purchase of this game despite all the praise it received. I had no desire to spend 50 dollars on a genre that I don’t even enjoy that much, but at 14.99 I feel like I outright robbed the devs.   Graphically Wolfenstein is stellar; I didn’t encounter a single muddled texture or janky pop-in. Animations are natural and varied. The gun effects are meaty and unbelievably deadly feeling. Sound design reflects this quality with heavy, forceful gunshots and chaotic combat chatter as you mow down nazi foes. Everything about the presentation is just perfect.   But every modern FPS is shiny, the problem is that they are all bland, stale, predictable, and just plain boring to play. Not Wolfenstein, dear god not this game. You are unnaturally quick, agile and can leap and slide about the stage whilst dual wielding assault rifles.When the game gives you guns, it wants you to go ape with them. On top of that, Wolfenstein goes back to the good ol’ days of magical bottomless pockets, allowing you to carry about a full arsenal of chaos to use as you see fit. Gunning down one room only to slide into the next stealthily tossing knives into the backs of any nazi whose back is foolishly turned is pure joy.   As if making a good feeling shooter in this day and age isn’t reason enough to celebrate, the storyline and character development is mind blowing. Sure the emotions won’t be running as high as your first time playing The Walking Dead, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t swept away into the struggles of the protagonist and his rag-tag group of freedom fighters. With some seriously dark and difficult topics hit on with such taste and creativity, when the cutscenes are rolling it’s hard to believe this is an old school nazi killing arcade. That is, until the tone switches to absurd 80’s action movie mode and you gather around the round table to hatch a crazy plot to mow down more nazis. When you can go from entering a concentration camp-witnessing all the horrors associated with a locale of that nature- to melting nazis on the moon with laser assault rifles and never breaking the flow of the narrative or gameplay then you have accomplished something magical.   I could harp all day on how each part of Wolfenstein is expertly crafted, but the pinnacle of achievement here is the inconceivably masterful balance between so many conflicting styles, themes and narratives. Wolfenstein: The New Order is by far one of the best games I’ve played in 2015.",1,even begin wolfenstein new order phenomenal kept delaying purchase game despite praise received desire spend dollars genre dont even enjoy much feel like outright robbed devs graphically wolfenstein stellar didnt encounter single muddled texture janky popin animations natural varied gun effects meaty unbelievably deadly feeling sound design reflects quality heavy forceful gunshots chaotic combat chatter mow nazi foes everything presentation perfect every modern fps shiny problem bland stale predictable plain boring play wolfenstein dear god game unnaturally quick agile leap slide stage whilst dual wielding assault rifleswhen game gives guns wants go ape top wolfenstein goes back good ol days magical bottomless pockets allowing carry full arsenal chaos use see fit gunning one room slide next stealthily tossing knives backs nazi whose back foolishly turned pure joy making good feeling shooter day age isnt reason enough celebrate storyline character development mind blowing sure emotions wont running high first time playing walking dead id lying said wasnt swept away struggles protagonist ragtag group freedom fighters seriously dark difficult topics hit taste creativity cutscenes rolling hard believe old school nazi killing arcade tone switches absurd action movie mode gather around round table hatch crazy plot mow nazis go entering concentration campwitnessing horrors associated locale nature melting nazis moon laser assault rifles never breaking flow narrative gameplay accomplished something magical could harp day part wolfenstein expertly crafted pinnacle achievement inconceivably masterful balance many conflicting styles themes narratives wolfenstein new order far one best games ive played,"game that was a re-make of the original.

"------------------------- Updated Review: ------------------------- Wow, this game really is awesome! After having finished the game, I have to amend my original review. The control scheme took very little time to get used to and I actually like it now. As for the level design and enemies, this game did as well as most any I've played - there were enough different enemies to keep it interesting and though there was not a ton of variation in environment, the levels were still each unique enough to make it fun.  The plot is cool, for a game that's designed to be linear, not an open world for exploring. I definitely like the upgrade system - if you're diligent about destroying everything for upgrade parts, you'll have more than enough to upgrade yourself, all your weapons, and your robotic companion. The skill tree is pretty cool - it's important to note that you will not get enough points to fill out the entire skill tree so you have to make some choices about what's best suited to your playing style.  One issue I had at a few points during the game is the path-finding ability of the companion robot, though he was able to follow most of the time. Beyond that, I really have no complaints and it was enough fun that I will likely play through again.  ----------------------- Original Review: ----------------------- I've only played for a little over an hour - just the first couple of missions - and I can see what some of the negative reviews are talking about. The two main issues seem to be the bad control scheme and repetitive level design.  First, the control scheme is pretty wonky - it kind of reminds me of Harbinger, a 2003 action RPG developed by Silverback Entertainment and published by Dreamcatcher Interactive. It would play a lot better with WASD movement like the Halo games Spartant Assault and Spartan Strike. Second, I can already see some repetitive design in the environment and the enemies.  Despite these issues, I'm really enjoying the game so far. I like the (admittedly simple) skill tree and the weapon/armor upgrade system. It's certainly not an in-depth system you'd expect out of a more hardcore RPG but it's a nice, light, action RPG, reminiscent of games like Diablo. It would be nice to be able to carry more than four health packs but that's pretty minor. Overall, I find it to be a good time-waster of a game. I suppose my opinion might change as I get further into the game but, so far, it's been a lot of fun.",1,updated review wow game really awesome finished game amend original review control scheme took little time get used actually like level design enemies game well ive played enough different enemies keep interesting though ton variation environment levels still unique enough make fun plot cool game thats designed linear open world exploring definitely like upgrade system youre diligent destroying everything upgrade parts youll enough upgrade weapons robotic companion skill tree pretty cool important note get enough points fill entire skill tree make choices whats best suited playing style one issue points game pathfinding ability companion robot though able follow time beyond really complaints enough fun likely play original review ive played little hour first couple missions see negative reviews talking two main issues seem bad control scheme repetitive level design first control scheme pretty wonky kind reminds harbinger action rpg developed silverback entertainment published dreamcatcher interactive would play lot better wasd movement like halo games spartant assault spartan strike second already see repetitive design environment enemies despite issues im really enjoying game far like admittedly simple skill tree weaponarmor upgrade system certainly indepth system youd expect hardcore rpg nice light action rpg reminiscent games like diablo would nice able carry four health packs thats pretty minor overall find good timewaster game suppose opinion might change get game far lot fun,Keeps only sentimental words: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

" Costume Quest  is a Double Fine RPG set around Halloween where by some magical intervention, your character and his or her friends gain the ability to transform into super powered versions of their costumes to save your sibling who has been mistakenly kidnapped as a result of dressing in a terrible candy costume.  It's very... Double Fine. I really don't know how they make their games all feel so similar despite them having different mechanics and stories and settings. Art and dialogue, I suppose. Anyway, that's my only negative-ish criticism.  It's a pretty good short RPG, with quick time attacks/dodging similar to the Mario RPGs. It is actually reasonably difficult despite how it might look so if you're buying this for kids, consider that. I like the innovation of having 'random encounters' limited to houses where you're trick or treating. The story is kind of sparse, but manages to touch on some themes of the difficulties of siblinghood.

"This game is pretty damn good. While it can be a bit repetitive at first its flaws are swept away at how well this game handles the idea of exploration. As a gamer that particularly enjoys dungeon crawlers and games that encourage exploration and risk, I walked into this game a bit exited, but held back the exitement over it as much as I could as to not overhype the game (though I was mainly exited because this was the first game on steam that I was exited to get) The game itself should be treated as a dungeon crawler / exploration game, especialy considering how many people say it is Minecraft but 2D. However, if you walk into this game expecting Minecraft, you will certainly be dissapointed. In fact, most of the negative reviews of the game regard someone saying that Terraria doesn't meet up to the standards of block based survival such as in Mincraft. But this, as seen from the first few minutes of gameplay, is clearly not, nor is it trying to be, a survival game. The real thrill of this game comes from explaring and conquering new lands, learning to dominate the new biomes you discover. I remember when I first found the Corruption: When I first discovered this new territory, I decided to journey into its dark (and fairly sharp) depths to discover whatever secret lies beyont the mouth of the cave. But then I was killed by an Eater of Souls before getting to far. And thus I had a goal, get down there and figure out what in the world was hidden within it. The bottom line of this story is that this game is really good at encouraging you to explore. Finding chests and loot gives you better items that allow you to handle former challenges with ease (giving you a sence of player progression) and enabling you to explore deeper into parts that have previously stopped you by almost instant death.  So basically, I give this game a solid 9/10, -0.5 for having repetitive actions that come up too often, and -0.5 for having a building aspect that can be annoying to deal with whenever you want to add more NPCs to your town.",1,game pretty damn good bit repetitive first flaws swept away well game handles idea exploration gamer particularly enjoys dungeon crawlers games encourage exploration risk walked game bit exited held back exitement much could overhype game though mainly exited first game steam exited get game treated dungeon crawler exploration game especialy considering many people say minecraft however walk game expecting minecraft certainly dissapointed fact negative reviews game regard someone saying terraria doesnt meet standards block based survival mincraft seen first minutes gameplay clearly trying survival game real thrill game comes explaring conquering new lands learning dominate new biomes discover remember first found corruption first discovered new territory decided journey dark fairly sharp depths discover whatever secret lies beyont mouth cave killed eater souls getting far thus goal get figure world hidden within bottom line story game really good encouraging explore finding chests loot gives better items allow handle former challenges ease giving sence player progression enabling explore deeper parts previously stopped almost instant death basically give game solid repetitive actions come often building aspect annoying deal whenever want add npcs town,is a huge plus.

"This is one of the most interesting and expansive games out there. The current storyline and background is a bit unrealistic-The Republic of Altis and Stratis has a super-advanced military but the nation has under 50,000 people in its population. The population also is Greek, but for whatever reason all speaks english-even the armed forces. Nonetheless, the mission editing is superb compared to Arma 2, the mechanics are mostly improved (animation and AI needing a bit of a change for realism) the voice acting for British and American English as well as Farsi is superb. Iran has a huge presence in the game, however it is never mentioned and instead goes under the quite unrealistic banner of Canton-Protocol Strategic Alliance Treaty, or CSAT. I really wish that BIS would at least include the Iran flag above the CSAT insignia on the uniforms, for it looked absolutely amazing when this was the case at E3 2011. Physics in the game are great, however the fabled ragdoll physics are a bit dissapointing. All they seem to do is make units die in a more unrealistic-looking way. NATO is portrayed as completely bankrupt which really bothers me-unemployment is at freaking 50% in the US. It is interesting to see future interpretations of the US Army, which use the new multicam pattern in their uniforms. I am bothered by the lack of ANY, yes ANY authentic equipment in the game. This is perhaps my biggest problem, for it gives the developers an excuse to make fantasy content for every upcoming Arma game. Yes, it saves on lisencing, but the developers just launched a 650-thousand dollar modding contest. A fraction of the money could have been spent on making the weapons and vehicles authentic.   With a host of friends to play with, some mods, and an open mind, this title is one of the most awesome games I have ever played. The simulation of the vehicles is amazing, with support for almost every joystick, controller, or other external device you can think of. The game fails to provide an immersive atmosphere but is a fun and engaging way to play COOP with friends, strategy being completely necessary. The graphics are in my top 10 games ever, and the performance is better than with Arma 2, especially if you plan on making Youtube videos like I do. (check out my Youtube channel: FistoGames :D ) Go and buy it. With some DLC's that bring it back to where Arma 2 was in scenario, it will definitely be an amazing game.

"Let me start by saying that I   highly   recommend this game personally. However, this game is not necessarily meant for every player out there. When I had purchased the game I had no intention of playing the storyline and instead wanted to move directly to personal multiplayer with friends. After I bought the game I wanted to try it out just for fun (and I might as well since 'usually' games have a single player function for a reason.)   I was of course thrown into the very first driving sequence with was complimented by jerky controls, poorly lit streets, and the overall nagging tone of your cousin, Roman, who later goes on to consistently ask you about going bowling together. Besides the fact that the streets are laced with ice every time you take a stroll, the visuals were very in-depth for an open world game aside from the occasional .jpg windows. Storyline begins to build up the more you play (as it should,) and you begin to feel a bit of connection with the characters that you meet. Each person seems to be realistic; having set wants, needs, and different personalities that either make you love them or want to take them into your car and drive headfirst into a hotdog vendor.   The missions are fun and always try to throw in something different with every new one that pops up from time to time. Simple missions like   Take Roman home   turn into  1. Take Roman home 2. Shoot out the 12 police cars chasing you 3. Lose your wanted level 4. Drive all the way back to the wharf 5. Steal a Chopper 6. Meet Roman again to go bowling    While I full heartedly   love   this game I have plenty of reason why I also hate it at the same time. - Slippery roads (it really makes a difference) - Police seem to only care if they feel like it - Police really love their vehicles so don't hit them... Ever - Outlandishly difficult 'slaughter everything that moves' missions -  Shotguns hate you  - Vehicle collision glitch; Flying through the windshield seems to happen at random - No perspective of what is what is right or wrong (Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. My only concern was the fact that certain missions give you a choice in what to do, but the decision is hard to make seeing that everyone is this world is a jerk-off and you're basically a more brutal Jesus Christ.)  Overall, I'd say if you haven't played it before and you're interested in an a$$-backwards world of rude police officers and downright hopeless humanity filled to the brim with full automatic weapons and glitchy (but fun) driving mechanics , then I would say this game is for you good fellow.",1,let start saying highly recommend game personally however game necessarily meant every player purchased game intention playing storyline instead wanted move directly personal multiplayer friends bought game wanted try fun might well since usually games single player function reason course thrown first driving sequence complimented jerky controls poorly lit streets overall nagging tone cousin roman later goes consistently ask going bowling together besides fact streets laced ice every time take stroll visuals indepth open world game aside occasional jpg windows storyline begins build play begin feel bit connection characters meet person seems realistic set wants needs different personalities either make love want take car drive headfirst hotdog vendor missions fun always try throw something different every new one pops time time simple missions like take roman home turn take roman home shoot police cars chasing lose wanted level drive way back wharf steal chopper meet roman go bowling full heartedly love game plenty reason also hate time slippery roads really makes difference police seem care feel like police really love vehicles dont hit ever outlandishly difficult slaughter everything moves missions shotguns hate vehicle collision glitch flying windshield seems happen random perspective right wrong isnt necessarily bad thing concern fact certain missions give choice decision hard make seeing everyone world jerkoff youre basically brutal jesus christ overall id say havent played youre interested abackwards world rude police officers downright hopeless humanity filled brim full automatic weapons glitchy fun driving mechanics would say game good fellow,"I had no intention of playing the storyline, but I did.

Overall, great game, main story is pretty good and I recommend users to mod their graphics, and possibly use DSR for the ultimate experience.  Issues I have with the game;  Mako controls are a bit wonky - but you get used to it Side missions are kinda dull after you do a few of them you've basically experienced all of them -eg. Layouts on all of the compounds are virtually the exact same and you will spend most of your time driving around planets for at least 15+ hours collecting everything for experience.

"XCOM: Enemy Unknown - A 'sequel' I have been waiting for in years. I was a big fan of the orignal XCOM UFO Enemy Unknown and spent many hours playing that. This new game does honor to it's predecessor, without being exactly the same. This new game is 'entirely' different from the old one, and still it captures the magic it had. The gameplay does resemble the old game in some ways. There are 2 'main screens' there is the, building/managing your base screen, and then theres turnbased combat. The management system has been changed quite a lot from the old games, in some ways it's a lot more simple, and in others ways more advanced. You no longer have to worry about space for soldiers or hiring engineers/scientists. Your squads now consist of a maximum of 6 soldiers, whereas in first game you could have more than 14 with you on a mission. In this game however your soldiers furfill different roles, so there's medics, snipers, heavy support and more. It feels like they've focussed a bit more on combat in this game, and kept more or less the same amount of basemanaging. The basemanaging consists of doing research to unlock new equipment, production of new equipment and building new facilities. Also you have to manage your satellite overview, chosing which countries/regions of the world where you wanna be able to locate UFOs. This gives an interesting choice to the player as different countries gives different perks, and also the threat of actually 'losing' country/region permanently. During the basemanagement, alarms will suddenly blare and a mission will become available. This is one of the main changes to the original game. The original game had 3 different mission types: UFO Landing/Crashsite, Terror and Basedefense. This game has loads more, and makes the combat much more varied and also very very fun. The new class system and soldier abilities gives you a variaty of ways to solve these missions, and a multitude of aliens will try and prevent you from archieving your objectives. This leads to a very enjoyable experience when battling the many aliens in different settings like woods, spaceships, towns and futuristic bases. The graphics in the game is good. It's nothing special nor is it terrible. One of minor flaws in the game is the camera and the angle it's in. You can zoom in and out, and also rotate the camera in 4 positions, but sometimes in certain missions the angle and zoom of the camera is just plain annoying. You have soldiers on different levels (heights) on a map and switching between them makes the camera adjust violently. Just switching between soldiers 'activates' this. In turnbased combat, where tactics is kinda important, this leads to a momentary loss of the current situation/overview. This however is a very minor flaw, but I feel like they could have made the camera and overall feel of the turnbased combat a little less 'strict'. Generally the game is extremely good, the only real flaw is that 'strictness' I feel when playing, but it's quick to get used to, and the awesome gameplay will make you forget it very fast.",1,xcom enemy unknown sequel waiting years big fan orignal xcom ufo enemy unknown spent many hours playing new game honor predecessor without exactly new game entirely different old one still captures magic gameplay resemble old game ways main screens buildingmanaging base screen theres turnbased combat management system changed quite lot old games ways lot simple others ways advanced longer worry space soldiers hiring engineersscientists squads consist maximum soldiers whereas first game could mission game however soldiers furfill different roles theres medics snipers heavy support feels like theyve focussed bit combat game kept less amount basemanaging basemanaging consists research unlock new equipment production new equipment building new facilities also manage satellite overview chosing countriesregions world wanna able locate ufos gives interesting choice player different countries gives different perks also threat actually losing countryregion permanently basemanagement alarms suddenly blare mission become available one main changes original game original game different mission types ufo landingcrashsite terror basedefense game loads makes combat much varied also fun new class system soldier abilities gives variaty ways solve missions multitude aliens try prevent archieving objectives leads enjoyable experience battling many aliens different settings like woods spaceships towns futuristic bases graphics game good nothing special terrible one minor flaws game camera angle zoom also rotate camera positions sometimes certain missions angle zoom camera plain annoying soldiers different levels heights map switching makes camera adjust violently switching soldiers activates turnbased combat tactics kinda important leads momentary loss current situationoverview however minor flaw feel like could made camera overall feel turnbased combat little less strict generally game extremely good real flaw strictness feel playing quick get used awesome gameplay make forget fast,XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a great game.

But that problem aside, the time I have spent in-game (when it would decide to function) was greatly enjoyable.

"A good hacking slashing brawl with ideas.... but if you are using a AMD card, I recommend you to not buy this game or you will crash every 15 minutes or so  Pros: A nice health system where you regen health by consuming people and taking there disguise. Nice movement system but at first it abit weird, i recommend upgrading it first. You gain new powers at certain missions which open up the combat: There are human types that die quickly and can be consumed then there the 1v1 types that require your powers to stun then or other things. The random upgrade system works well; You either sneak up on them and consume them, grab them and consume them, if they are a 1v1 enemy beat them up and then consume then but your enemies like killing them. The powers are nice.  Cons: I recommend doing story missions to gain all of the powers You can pick up guns but the targeting system is hard to use, and if you want to use your powers you drop your guns, you cant hold any guns. The tanks and helicopter suck since you are a mortal god. When 3 or more 1v1 enemies come out, it is annoying as they need you to focus on them but they rush you At the beginning, your health dont regen unless you eat it The side missions are cool but you need to often hunt a target to do the mission, The audio logs are hard to find sometimes. Heller isnt the great protaginst and is generic The missions you got to stay in disguise and use guns against 1v1 enemies get annoying. Amd video cards cause the game to crash or freeze up like there is no tomorrow  I recommend this game but make sure you dont have a AMD, It a pretty good sandbox game    ",1,good hacking slashing brawl ideas using amd card recommend buy game crash every minutes pros nice health system regen health consuming people taking disguise nice movement system first abit weird recommend upgrading first gain new powers certain missions open combat human types die quickly consumed v types require powers stun things random upgrade system works well either sneak consume grab consume v enemy beat consume enemies like killing powers nice cons recommend story missions gain powers pick guns targeting system hard use want use powers drop guns cant hold guns tanks helicopter suck since mortal god v enemies come annoying need focus rush beginning health dont regen unless eat side missions cool need often hunt target mission audio logs hard find sometimes heller isnt great protaginst generic missions got stay disguise use guns v enemies get annoying amd video cards cause game crash freeze like tomorrow recommend game make sure dont amd pretty good sandbox game,"I'm a fan of the original, but I'm not a fan of the sequel.

"This is a good game which will be overlooked as forgettable by once mountain-dew-addled-teens who are now adults as choose your own adventure GTA. This game has more in common with world exploration games and the old arcade classic Dragonslair than it ever did with the zany violent world of Grand Theft Auto.   The developers have presented an entire world full of beautiful set pieces, interesting and engaging characters and violence that is presented as a story device rather than reward for getting through the narrative elements. Sure, the game plays pretty much the same on replay but with hundreds of variations depending on who you kill, where you go first and what questions you ask.   The game has been cheap often for a long time now and if you haven't had the pleasure of digging into a game that will make you feel something different, you should get this.",1,good game overlooked forgettable mountaindewaddledteens adults choose adventure gta game common world exploration games old arcade classic dragonslair ever zany violent world grand theft auto developers presented entire world full beautiful set pieces interesting engaging characters violence presented story device rather reward getting narrative elements sure game plays pretty much replay hundreds variations depending kill go first questions ask game cheap often long time havent pleasure digging game make feel something different get,"GTA than GTA, but it's still a good game."

" Pros:    Lots of blocks to choose from, you won't run out of choices.   2 layers of blocks/bricks to build in, the background and foreground layers, this allows for creative structures.   Game is extremely light-weight and easy to run, you could run it on a toaster.   Tons of weapons and tools to craft.   Lots of decoration blocks. (glasses, cups, chandliers, etc.)   NPC's to interact with in singleplayer and multiplayer.   Controls are easy to learn, yet complex and sophisticated.   No goals or objectives, its a sandbox box, the sky is the limit.   Extremely customizable character with first creation and armor, as well as vanity items.   Character slots are saved to character, and not to world.   Unlimited amount of characters.   TONS of enemys to fight.   Bosses to fight when you are strong enough can be summoned at any time, and not randomly.   Cons:    The start of a new world is a little boring.   Some enemy designs are bad.    If you love sandbox games, Terraria is a must-have. There is no game out there with such a huge variety of activities to do. With such a low price of just $10, how could you turn it down?",1,pros lots blocks choose wont run choices layers blocksbricks build background foreground layers allows creative structures game extremely lightweight easy run could run toaster tons weapons tools craft lots decoration blocks glasses cups chandliers etc npcs interact singleplayer multiplayer controls easy learn yet complex sophisticated goals objectives sandbox box sky limit extremely customizable character first creation armor well vanity items character slots saved character world unlimited amount characters tons enemys fight bosses fight strong enough summoned time randomly cons start new world little boring enemy designs bad love sandbox games terraria musthave game huge variety activities low price could turn,a more complex build.

An excellent free to play game that's fun to dip back into. The action is fast paced bullet storm style and the controls work well. It's well balanced for both new and vetran players.

"This game is massive time killer. It manages to be both simple and addictive, while having no customization, no unlocks, no achievements, nothing to distract you. This game will have tens of thousands of players from all over the world for all eternity.   Those players are generally silent, but trolling and griefing is not at all unknown. This game is also very well known for cheaters. Several admins have bizarre rules that only make sense to them on their servers, so expect to be banned from a few.

"I'll preface this by saying that the story is absolutely daft, but nonetheless very enjoyable (except for the ending,which I hate, but individual opinions may vary). The characters are also extremely clichéd, but once again, enjoyment of this aspect is down to personal taste.   Now I've never played a Wolfenstien game before, so I didn't know what to expect when going in to this, but this is an absolutely fantastic game. While I may of had quibbles with the story, the gameplay is top-notch, making this one of the most fun games I have ever played. And the fun carries through to just about every aspect of the game: the stealth, the gunplay (dual-wielding shotguns!) the boss fights, the intense amount of gore and blood, finding all of the collectibles - it's just all so satisfying  I do have one gripe and that is that the missions in the Resistance base are quite boring. Assaulting a German prison followed by looking for tools around a base, really takes you out of the action, especially as they only serve for in some character exposition.   The game also features my number one most hated feature in a steam game: hidden achievements. I can understand it for story related achievements to prevent spoilers, but hiding achievements that relate to collectibles is just plain stupid and I can see no reason to do it.   Special mention must go to the people who wrote the lore (which is once again fantastic) which is discovered through a few ways. The first is various newspaper clippings hanging on walls or sitting on desks. The second is through the journal entries and recordings and finally through the games soundtrack. Yes there are collectible records that have songs from the alternate timeline that this game is set in. My personal favorites are 'Tapferer Kleiner Liebling' (which parodies Sonny and Cher's duets from the 60's) and 'House of the Rising Sun' (which of course is a parody of The Animals' 'House of the Rising Sun').  All in all, the story is daft, the achievements are hidden but Mein Führer is it fun. And it's only $20! What a bargain!",1,ill preface saying story absolutely daft nonetheless enjoyable except endingwhich hate individual opinions may vary characters also extremely clichd enjoyment aspect personal taste ive never played wolfenstien game didnt know expect going absolutely fantastic game may quibbles story gameplay topnotch making one fun games ever played fun carries every aspect game stealth gunplay dualwielding shotguns boss fights intense amount gore blood finding collectibles satisfying one gripe missions resistance base quite boring assaulting german prison followed looking tools around base really takes action especially serve character exposition game also features number one hated feature steam game hidden achievements understand story related achievements prevent spoilers hiding achievements relate collectibles plain stupid see reason special mention must go people wrote lore fantastic discovered ways first various newspaper clippings hanging walls sitting desks second journal entries recordings finally games soundtrack yes collectible records songs alternate timeline game set personal favorites tapferer kleiner liebling parodies sonny chers duets house rising sun course parody animals house rising sun story daft achievements hidden mein fhrer fun bargain,"lovable, and the dialogue is witty and witty.

The dialogue knows its place, the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is absolutely solid. A great balance between combat and defensive strategy. The maps ramp in difficulty quite nicely, and the creators were smart to add enemies that will mess with tactics that worked a few maps ago. Forcing the player to really think about each map is something that shows good game design and I really admire it. If you like tower defense games and are looking for something a bit different, definitely check this out.",1,genuinely surprised game like killing orcs thank warhammer space marine decided pick simply great game dialogue knows place graphics beautiful gameplay absolutely solid great balance combat defensive strategy maps ramp difficulty quite nicely creators smart add enemies mess tactics worked maps ago forcing player really think map something shows good game design really admire like tower defense games looking something bit different definitely check,I'm a fan of the series and I'm glad I was able to play it.

"As you probably already know, Quantum Conundrum is a new game from Kim Swift, the creator of Portal. And while it does share a few similarities with Portal (1st person puzzle solving, an omnipresent narrator), QC is a distinctly unique experience. Instead of Portals, the tools at your disposal are 4 'dimensions' (fluffy, heavy, slow-mo and reverse-grav), which you can swap between at will. Just like in Portal, each dimension, and the various techniques needed to solve puzzles using them, are introduced gradually. Each of the 3 main levels start out easy, but end up requiring ever-more mind-bending uses of the various dimension shifts to solve. I never found the game to be particularly hard, but you will definitely have to think hard about some of the solutions. All in all, it's very satisfying as a puzzle game. One other note - in addition to puzzles, a significant degree of platforming skill is required throughout (just something to be aware of). Great game... highly recommended!",1,probably already know quantum conundrum new game kim swift creator portal share similarities portal st person puzzle solving omnipresent narrator qc distinctly unique experience instead portals tools disposal dimensions fluffy heavy slowmo reversegrav swap like portal dimension various techniques needed solve puzzles using introduced gradually main levels start easy end requiring evermore mindbending uses various dimension shifts solve never found game particularly hard definitely think hard solutions satisfying puzzle game one note addition puzzles significant degree platforming skill required throughout something aware great game highly recommended,"), it's not exactly the same game."

"Interesting story based on 'Immortel (ad vitam)' animation film that came out 2004.  Point and click game in FPS view. Some puzzles makes no sense, like it is hard to spot a piece of rock on the floor, while it is least obvious thing to look for to make progress.  Game is short. It only makes longer if the player stuck at some puzzle for long hours. Luckily there are walkthrough videos on the net. If every puzzle in the head, i doubt the game lasts longer than 1 hour.  Graphics are nice, music is awesome.  Overall, buying it on discount makes worth playing it.",1,interesting story based immortel ad vitam animation film came point click game fps view puzzles makes sense like hard spot piece rock floor least obvious thing look make progress game short makes longer player stuck puzzle long hours luckily walkthrough videos net every puzzle head doubt game lasts longer hour graphics nice music awesome overall buying discount makes worth playing,but the story is good.
"When I saw this game at first I thought something along the lines of 'Looks alright I'll buy it when there's a sale'. So in the autumn 2016 sale I bought it. I finished it the very next day.  Best. Decision. Ever.  11 hours of shooting people in two days but it didn't get boring. In fact as I progressed through the over-the-top steampunk 1960s I connected more and more with the game and the story. The story legitimately suprised my in this sense. As my home is in the multiplayer shooters and the campaigns are more of a 'Oh my internet is down I'll play this'. There are two main stories, which split with decisions you make ingame, which I have played one of. The story that I finished (fergus') was presented with solid script and many moments of genuis, comically or in set peices.  The gameplay as a whole is thoughly intertaining with the loud and brash or stealthy and silent options presented, both giving satifying results and above all else Gore. The gore and horrors this series is famed for, while not shown by throwing bucket-loads of blood, is ever present and satisfying especaily on the antagonists.   Lastly for all the graphic enthusiasts. While this game is not massively intensive to run it still looks georgous.  Overall I would throurghly reccomend this game and encourage you not to overlook it.",1,saw game first thought something along lines looks alright ill buy theres sale autumn sale bought finished next day best decision ever hours shooting people two days didnt get boring fact progressed overthetop steampunk connected game story story legitimately suprised sense home multiplayer shooters campaigns oh internet ill play two main stories split decisions make ingame played one story finished fergus presented solid script many moments genuis comically set peices gameplay whole thoughly intertaining loud brash stealthy silent options presented giving satifying results else gore gore horrors series famed shown throwing bucketloads blood ever present satisfying especaily antagonists lastly graphic enthusiasts game massively intensive run still looks georgous overall would throurghly reccomend game encourage overlook,It and I'm glad I did.

"I highly recommend this game. It is a lot of fun. I enjoy the art style, the narration, the simple gameplay. I would advise people to look up Transistor (on PC and PS4) by the same developers of Bastion. I have yet to complete the game, and will not spoil one bit of this story. What I will say is that this game is suitable for young teens and some children in terms of how charmin the game is and to not just simply play for the sake of playing, but to enjoy the little story in the game. The game seems to some extent like a children's book which is a very nice thing. This game's gameplay mechanics are simple enough for children 10 years of age, but there are a few 7 or 8 year olds that might play without really struggling. The controls are simple, if using a Xbox 360 controller you are allowed to customize button layout so X can be ranged attack instead of default. Same for the Keyboard controls. As far as attacks go, you can melee, range atack, defend, use a special attack, reload, heal, and dodge roll (from what I remember). As for Transistor, the game is out May 20th 2014 (2014, May 20th/ 20th of May 2014/ 20 de Mayo del 2014).",1,highly recommend game lot fun enjoy art style narration simple gameplay would advise people look transistor pc ps developers bastion yet complete game spoil one bit story say game suitable young teens children terms charmin game simply play sake playing enjoy little story game game seems extent like childrens book nice thing games gameplay mechanics simple enough children years age year olds might play without really struggling controls simple using xbox controller allowed customize button layout x ranged attack instead default keyboard controls far attacks go melee range atack defend use special attack reload heal dodge roll remember transistor game may th may th th may de mayo del,) and see what they think.

This game has many levels that you can go past with little resistence, then the next level all of you best units start killing each other. This game is not for the faint of heart, most missions feel like they can be your last. Your base of operation has a nice feel to it with the area 51 type vibe to it, and upgrading all of your units with better wepons used from alien tec feels nice. The best comparison I can think of for this game is fire emblem, but with aliens and all of you freind dead. This is not a casual game, expect to fail, I suggest to save often, or if you have the balls have iorn man mode on so you only have one save file. My only suggestion for this game is to play in short bursts because this game has the just one more turn type feel to it. Always make your troop go into overwatch when moving forward.

"I got this game when it was first released and even back then it was a great game about going around, gathering throwing stars, making health potions and killing the eye of C'Thulu.  But what is it? Is it like 2D minecraft? Not really, while miecraft is more about the creative values of building, terraria is more of a voxel based RPG where you go around visiting the different biomes and finding or crafting rare weapons, armors and trinkets. You'll also be building your own village to get different NPC's that sell you different items or give you mini quests. You'll have your world evolve while you go through the fdifferent difficulty phases of the game. You'll be creating more maps for you character to visit so that you can get all the rare items that your first map didn't generate. (Characters kee their inventory when changing maps.)  Pros: - Easy to set up multiplayer. - Vast worlds to explore. - Scaling difficulty based on the bosses you fight. - Invasions - ♥♥♥♥ ton of items. - Lots of building materials if you still get the creative urge (including logic gates) - Will keep you busy for a very long time. - And more (magic, minecart systems, fishing, pets, mounts, capture the gem, etc.)  Cons: - Modding scene not as active as Starbound or Minecraft - Some items are really hard to get. - Going through the difficulties can take a very long time.

Torchlight 2 is a dungeon crawler lootfest and it never gets old! The four main classes are all amazingly put together and balanced, not to mention the countless number of user created classes and mods out there to make your experience even more unique and exciting.

"A well placed touch up on weapons and general gameplay with an asetic bolester that fit will and didnt go to far or to little. The game albiet being a bit shorter than FEAR (mind you i only did about 75% of all the collectible scavenger buttcrap we all love to do in playthrough 2 whenever we get to it) It packs alot of content into the short time, it moves by slowly and holds your grip well. I enjoyed how very human the characters and enviornments were, from silly refrences to real life facts to movie poster to family photos to equating the Development Team to First Graders. All weapons were greatly viable to pick up and play with and could support you through your endeavor, SMG left on full auto for quick mow downs, ARs set to single fire for cover sniping, auto shotty for your favorite psychotic leapers. The classic Nail Gun is back and is just as adorable and lovable and totes its shiny newself well to the general asetics. Newest addition in the game was the Sniper Rifle and was simply wonderful, though the sway could go unoticed and make aiming tough cause you could randomly miss on occasion. As a comparision to FEAR / Extraction, it was much more horror elemented and set a harsh slow gonna ♥♥♥♥ you up ambience that persisted from area to area and kept the real scares fairly scary, some of the scares got repeatitive and lose thier effect as you start to expect them but thats kinda human nature so /shrug. so overall Its a Reccomendable game with a fun setting, refreshing weapons, and nicely rebalanced health/armor system.

"Although this game is old and has been 'replaced' with a second in its series, it still holds a place in my heart of one of my favorite passing times.

This game is legendary and is of its own, standing seperatly from the second in the franchise, it is a special game to me and hopefully to everyone else that had the chance to experience this piece of red art where british people with the same voice could enjoy a nice day in london against not-so-british zeds that wanted to eat british people.

I love terraria and Minecraft. But I favor Terraria over Minecraft because Terraria has way more imaginitive and histerical items. This ranges from killing a giant eye with nothing but a rainbow gun to getting achievments for completely slaughtering zombies with a minecart. This amazing 2D styled plateformer game has made so much progress in only a few updates. I find this game beautifuly made. I suggest anyone who is thinking of buying this game to have no doubt.

"This game was on a 93% off discount recently, going at 0.99 USD a piece. It's possible for me to fork out a single buck from my steam wallet after liquidating some of my items, so, why not?  The first thing you should know about this game is that, there is a reason why it's score is 36/100. Yes, this game is crudely made and, in most manner, buggy, but that does not mean that this gmae isn't fun. You will get to witness some seriously ridiculous conditions, such as rains or blizzards that which can pretty much blind you. There are also times where you can get your hands on some vehicles. Cherish them, as me and my friend managed to ram more than 100 enemies while driving an average looking hummer jeep (and it 'capsized' after my friend tried to ram a boss and failed).   I didn't play much to give a full account on how to stretch this game to its full potential, though I am certain this will be a great party game and its worth a laugh or two.

"Great game, I have put many hours into it and had a lot of fun playing it. In my opinion it is definitely worth the €10,- steam sells it for.  Things I found good about this game: -The game has a lot of items, biomes, NPC's and bosses, which means a lot for the player to explore. -The game doesn't get updated often, but when it gets updated, lots of new things are added. -It is a lot of fun to play alone, but even more fun to play with friends. Downsides to this game: -Because there are so many different items and NPC's it can be hard for beginners to start off, this can be countered with the terraria wiki and the help of friends.",1,great game put many hours lot fun playing opinion definitely worth steam sells things found good game game lot items biomes npcs bosses means lot player explore game doesnt get updated often gets updated lots new things added lot fun play alone even fun play friends downsides game many different items npcs hard beginners start countered terraria wiki help friends,"- The game is very well made, the graphics are very good, the sound is good, the controls are good, the story is good, the music is good, the story is good, the game is fun, the game is fun, the game is fun, the game is fun, the game is"

The game isn't just a MilSim, it's also a Zombie survival game, a kart racing game, an RTS game, a role-playing game, and much much more. The massive multiplayer online community for this game has thrived off of it's community created and endorsed custom multiplayer modes, like classic Arma 3 DayZ, Altis Life, Wasteland, or even Battle Royale. There's plenty of servers to join, and plenty of gamemodes to try. All of them have their own unique kinks and features to make it a completely unique experience from the base game. There's even a massively in-depth editor mode in which you can create your own singleplayer or multiplayer scenarios using all the assets in the game, ranging from soldiers to scuba-submarines. With tonnes of script functionality implemented into the game, the editor truly is an endless pool of opportunities. The game as a whole is amazingly worth the base price itself, but if you can grab it on sale (especially the Winter or Summer sale) then it's an absolute steal. The only thing to look out for when purchasing this game are the minimum requirements. It takes a pretty good PC to run this game so make sure you have a proper set up before you invest into this game, other than that, it's fantastic and I highly reccomend it to anyone that enjoys any kind of First Person Shooter experience.",1,love arma series arma definitely favorite series far much detail extremely community friendly game isnt milsim also zombie survival game kart racing game rts game roleplaying game much much massive multiplayer online community game thrived community created endorsed custom multiplayer modes like classic arma dayz altis life wasteland even battle royale theres plenty servers join plenty gamemodes try unique kinks features make completely unique experience base game theres even massively indepth editor mode create singleplayer multiplayer scenarios using assets game ranging soldiers scubasubmarines tonnes script functionality implemented game editor truly endless pool opportunities game whole amazingly worth base price grab sale especially winter summer sale absolute steal thing look purchasing game minimum requirements takes pretty good pc run game make sure proper set invest game fantastic highly reccomend anyone enjoys kind first person shooter experience,"Arma 3 is a great game, it's a great community."

"I'm 104 hours in and still learning new things. I just got every single achievement and now I feel that I can give an accurate representation of this game. It's a great game with hundreds of different items and tons of things to do. One issue is the multiplayer. This really isn't something that they could fix easily, but I just feel that aside from servers and such, It's not really built for multiplayer, especially considering that rare drops have to be spread equally and getting potions and that kind of thing is really a pain, especially if all of your people aren't experienced. But this is a great game. I would reccomend it 95% for anyone who is or used to be interested in minecraft but wants something that a) isn't cancer, and b) has more content.",1,im hours still learning new things got every single achievement feel give accurate representation game great game hundreds different items tons things one issue multiplayer really isnt something could fix easily feel aside servers really built multiplayer especially considering rare drops spread equally getting potions kind thing really pain especially people arent experienced great game would reccomend anyone used interested minecraft wants something isnt cancer b content,a great story and a great soundtrack.

"Awesome game it really is. Visually stunning even for a 2008 game, looks beautiful. The game play at time can be frustrating in crucial second shaving segments, and the reaction time to take weapons seems a bit funky. Wonderful sound track, flows well with the game low sutle keys when platforming and more upbeat music when ♥♥♥♥ is hitting the fan.

"Its difficult to describe in words how much I love this game. I'm sure you can find very descriptive and articulate reviews below, so this review is going to be short and sweet.  Re-logic is the best gaming company I've ever come across. They don't release dlc that you have to pay for- they include all new content for free in patches for the game. They have consistently updated it for free for several years, and the game now has an insane amount of content- far more than some AAA titles even, and at a fraction of the price for that matter. I would definitely buy any other games which they offer. Great game, greatest company, very satisfying for any potential customers.  Honestly, I didn't want to even give this game a chance in the first place because I had played Minecraft and thought this was simply a clone. I can't believe how mistaken and close-minded I was. This game absolutely blows Minecraft out of the water. Minecraft has only the creativity and building appeal- Terraria has the same building aspect plus its an RPG-slayer heavily influenced by combat. While its true it is only 2D, It has hundreds of enemies and 14 bosses to fight, dozens of stages of progression delineated by armor an weapon tiers, melee, ranged, magic, and summoner combat styles, wings for flight and other mobility items, literally hundreds upon hundreds of items to use for crafting, furniture, weapons, etc, several special events to activate in game, adjustable difficulty and risk settings for personal preferance, and superb replayability- just to name a few aspects.  To me, it seems this game has no cons. Perhaps the 2D and graphics style is a turn-off for some elitists, but to me it is charming and quite fitting. The content has no flaws. If I could change anything about this game, it would simply be to encourage Re-Logic to continue adding to the game, because I love their work and this game.  This is a must-have for PC. I can't imagine how upsetting it would be if I hadn't even given this a chance- its a great journey and use of time.  10/10 BUY THIS GAME",1,difficult describe words much love game im sure find descriptive articulate reviews review going short sweet relogic best gaming company ive ever come across dont release dlc pay include new content free patches game consistently updated free several years game insane amount content far aaa titles even fraction price matter would definitely buy games offer great game greatest company satisfying potential customers honestly didnt want even give game chance first place played minecraft thought simply clone cant believe mistaken closeminded game absolutely blows minecraft water minecraft creativity building appeal terraria building aspect plus rpgslayer heavily influenced combat true hundreds enemies bosses fight dozens stages progression delineated armor weapon tiers melee ranged magic summoner combat styles wings flight mobility items literally hundreds upon hundreds items use crafting furniture weapons etc several special events activate game adjustable difficulty risk settings personal preferance superb replayability name aspects seems game cons perhaps graphics style turnoff elitists charming quite fitting content flaws could change anything game would simply encourage relogic continue adding game love work game musthave pc cant imagine upsetting would hadnt even given chance great journey use time buy game,"I'm a huge fan of the series, and I've played it since the first game.

"Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II is a real-time strategy / tactical role-playing video game developed by Relic Entertainment and published by THQ for Microsoft Windows based on the fictional Warhammer 40,000 universe. It is the sequel to the Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War video game series. Dawn of War II features a non-linear interplanetary campaign, as the Space Marines. The campaign can be played either as single-player or cooperatively with another player through an online connection.  The game's campaign departs from those of its predecessors in several key features. One of the most notable departures is that there are no base-building elements, unlike in previous Dawn of War titles. Instead, the player chooses the units to be used prior to beginning a mission, cannot build new units once the mission begins, and has only limited reinforcement options.   Has several multiplayer modes of play.  for more info:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I8Jmh8Nqvw    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKPUhMrNdpo    http://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii/pc-14243516    http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii-review/1900-6205011/    http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii    http://www.pcgamer.com/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii/    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhammer_40,000:_Dawn_of_War_II  ",1,warhammer dawn war ii realtime strategy tactical roleplaying video game developed relic entertainment published thq microsoft windows based fictional warhammer universe sequel warhammer dawn war video game series dawn war ii features nonlinear interplanetary campaign space marines campaign played either singleplayer cooperatively another player online connection games campaign departs predecessors several key features one notable departures basebuilding elements unlike previous dawn war titles instead player chooses units used prior beginning mission cannot build new units mission begins limited reinforcement options several multiplayer modes play info httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvijmhnqvw httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxkpuhmrndpo httpwwwigncomgameswarhammerdawnofwariipc httpwwwgamespotcomreviewswarhammerdawnofwariireview httpwwwmetacriticcomgamepcwarhammerdawnofwarii httpwwwpcgamercomwarhammerdawnofwarii httpsenwikipediaorgwikiwarhammerdawnofwarii,"Warhammer 40,000."
"I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.  Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of captivity.  But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself in exile in his own land. So we have come here today to dramatize an shameful condition.  In a sense we've come to our nation's Capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.  This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check; a check which has come back marked 'insufficient funds.'  But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this check- a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.  We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.  Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.  It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.  But there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.  The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone.  And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, 'When will you be satisfied?'  We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality.  We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities.  We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one.  We can never be satisfied as long as our chlidren are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating 'for whites only.'  We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote.  No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.  I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.  Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair.  I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.  I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal.'  I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.  I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.  I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.  I have a dream today.  I have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, that one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.  I have a dream today.  I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exhalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.  This is our hope. This is the faith that I will go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.  With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.  This will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning, 'My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing.

"monsters, monsters and much more dead monsters!  I have it since the release and all I can say is that it's a good horror survival. There are waves of monsters (not zombies, monsters) approaching and you just start off with a knife and a pistol. If you're lucky you find a better weapon but if not you need to think of a plan on how to kill all those basterds (damn you, censorship). After every round you can switch your class and buy weapons and then everything goes on, where every wave more monsters and/or stronger ones come. But don't focus on singleplayer. Killing Floor is meant to be played with your friends or even some strangers. More players = more ZEDs (they are called like this ingame) = more fun!  The graphics are good, the controls are easy to learn and I am sure everybody is able to hit a fat monster with a pistol. Or shotgun... or chainsaw.

"Best ♥♥♥♥-in sci-fi game ever, Best Mass Effect game. Unlike the other two games it actually felt like a sci-fi rather than a coated James Bond movie. Shame that Bioware ended up in EA's bed, because what could have followed this game could have been 10x better than what got produced.  If you're wondering why this game is better? Play it. I'll give you some hints  1. It's actually an RPG - Something Bioware forgot in its sequels is giving the player choices that actually matter, in this you can truly feel like you're choosing your own path rather than having it forced on you  2. The Reapers - At this point, we didn't know much about the reapers, but that's why they were such a great plot point: because they were mysterious. Perhaps it would have been better that way, keeping the player in the dark about them while fighting them. Mass Effect 2 kind of lost the feeling that the Reapers generated and by Mass Effect 3 they pretty much took a back seat the ♥♥♥♥ing Cerberus  3. It gives you a villain to rally around - We all hated Saren, not because he was a bad character but because he was a bad guy, and he did that so well. Harbinger just assumed control of people, we had very little interaction with him.   4. Feels like an actual epic sci fi - What the sequels tried to do and failed is to keep the story epic while making it also feel like a summer thriller... bad move. Mass Effect throws environments at you that are really alien, combined with its freaky techno music that haunts you to the core. Sure, you often get the generic mountain planets, but I think they managed to make it work somewhat, and on that note  5. Exploration - I get it, this isn't the U.S.S. Enterprise, you're hunting a criminal, but that doesn't mean you can't have a look around while you're out and about. You get to read up on strange planets, (the galaxy map usage in this is better too), explore them in a hilariously buggy tank, and do whatever you want. They are empty, for the most part, but it still feels fun. ME2 kind of continued it, but the lack of vehicular exploratation (sans the hammer) really didn't give the same vibe. Don't get me started on resource hunting in ME3  There's a bunch of other stuff I didn't touch on. Is it perfect? Hell no, it definitely has flaws, but I rather would have seen them get fixed instead of axed in the second game. It's really quite sad.  ♥♥♥♥ you EA",1,best scifi game ever best mass effect game unlike two games actually felt like scifi rather coated james bond movie shame bioware ended eas bed could followed game could x better got produced youre wondering game better play ill give hints actually rpg something bioware forgot sequels giving player choices actually matter truly feel like youre choosing path rather forced reapers point didnt know much reapers thats great plot point mysterious perhaps would better way keeping player dark fighting mass effect kind lost feeling reapers generated mass effect pretty much took back seat ing cerberus gives villain rally around hated saren bad character bad guy well harbinger assumed control people little interaction feels like actual epic sci fi sequels tried failed keep story epic making also feel like summer thriller bad move mass effect throws environments really alien combined freaky techno music haunts core sure often get generic mountain planets think managed make work somewhat note exploration get isnt uss enterprise youre hunting criminal doesnt mean cant look around youre get read strange planets galaxy map usage better explore hilariously buggy tank whatever want empty part still feels fun kind continued lack vehicular exploratation sans hammer really didnt give vibe dont get started resource hunting theres bunch stuff didnt touch perfect hell definitely flaws rather would seen get fixed instead axed second game really quite sad ea,"I'm a big fan of the game, and I've played it a few times."

"VERY GOOD FOR A SEQUEL  In comparison with P1, the only mission that hard in P2 is the Murder Your Maker mission and that is because I set it to the highest difficulty. In P1, even though I have finished the game few times, I still can die. In P2, your somehow almost invincible even at your first try. The infected in P2 is way less annoying than in P1.  The story in P2 is good enough for me but still feel shorter than P1 story. I can spend an hour at the red zone and completed all the mission. However, in terms of variety of mission, P2 definitely wins.  In terms of levels, you can hardly level up in P2. You only leveled up when you completed main/side mission, consume certain people/monsters, find black boxes. To reach max level,you have to play the game again in new game+. In P1, when you kill a hunter in a water tank, you got massive EP but that doesn't work with P2. For me, this is good because it forces you not to 'cheat'.  P2 has more comedic elements in it in comparison with P1.  If you want to buy this, do not hesitate to do it. Definitely worth the price but please finish P1 first before even starting P2.",1,good sequel comparison p mission hard p murder maker mission set highest difficulty p even though finished game times still die p somehow almost invincible even first try infected p way less annoying p story p good enough still feel shorter p story spend hour red zone completed mission however terms variety mission p definitely wins terms levels hardly level p leveled completed mainside mission consume certain peoplemonsters find black boxes reach max levelyou play game new game p kill hunter water tank got massive ep doesnt work p good forces cheat p comedic elements comparison p want buy hesitate definitely worth price please finish p first even starting p,"P1 you can do the missions in any order, but in P2 you can do them in any order."

"Great game that truly brings back Nazi slaying! The game starts off in an epic battle storming the beaches of Nazi germany territory.. and takes you right through into the 1960s portraying what reality of that time would have been like if the National Socialists would have won World War II. Great part on both iD Software and Bethesda's part.  The only negative? They used to iD6 engine.. which means graphical load lag.. no matter how good your PC, it's a software error. Don't get me wrong, the graphics are good.. but the engine they used has a bit of issue loading the bump mapping. So when you turn to look at a new part of the same, you can literally see the 'bump map' load in sections. Not too noticeable in combat scenes but really graphical parts of the game? Be prepared to know its a video game by having the graphics load slower than the 3d frames.. iD Software.. please fix this problem by the iD9 engine or you'll get some serious complaints about the next gen Wolfenstein titles.",1,great game truly brings back nazi slaying game starts epic battle storming beaches nazi germany territory takes right portraying reality time would like national socialists would world war ii great part id software bethesdas part negative used id engine means graphical load lag matter good pc software error dont get wrong graphics good engine used bit issue loading bump mapping turn look new part literally see bump map load sections noticeable combat scenes really graphical parts game prepared know video game graphics load slower frames id software please fix problem id engine youll get serious complaints next gen wolfenstein titles,a true war was like..

"Warhead was the successor of Crysis in 2008; a stand-alone expansion pack that was specifically released for PCs and, interestingly, did not require the original Crysis game to run. I remember this being praised for its better optimisation while the game at the same time had the exact same requirements as its predecessor. Also it looks better, there's not much difference, though, as it uses the same environments / assets as the original Crysis game.  The story is a tad bit unusual here - instead of this being a continuation to Crysis it actually takes place at the same time. However, the game puts us in the shoes of Psycho instead of Nomad. We pick up the story just after the two buddies get separated - with Psycho alone there's more focus on fighting the Korean military (initially, that is) as the emphasis is on retrieving / destroying the nuclear warhead they have in their possession (hence the title). I liked the in-game cutscenes they made for the game and the fact that we have a Korean colonel as the game's antagonist.  The campaign is, being part of an expansion pack, shorter than that of Crysis but is a BLAST! I found it more action-packed and interesting (even though we know there are aliens rampant on the island which is not a surprise anymore). Since multiplayer services no longer exist (see the disclaimer re GameSpy on the store page) there's no point in elaborating on that one.   Perhaps there's a solution for that, but this would definitely be something unofficial. Thus, at this point, this game is only worth purchasing for its short but satisfying campaign content. If discounted, it may just be a decent purchase and then you can make up your mind whether or not you want to see what Crytek achieved with Crysis 2.",1,warhead successor crysis standalone expansion pack specifically released pcs interestingly require original crysis game run remember praised better optimisation game time exact requirements predecessor also looks better theres much difference though uses environments assets original crysis game story tad bit unusual instead continuation crysis actually takes place time however game puts us shoes psycho instead nomad pick story two buddies get separated psycho alone theres focus fighting korean military initially emphasis retrieving destroying nuclear warhead possession hence title liked ingame cutscenes made game fact korean colonel games antagonist campaign part expansion pack shorter crysis blast found actionpacked interesting even though know aliens rampant island surprise anymore since multiplayer services longer exist see disclaimer gamespy store page theres point elaborating one perhaps theres solution would definitely something unofficial thus point game worth purchasing short satisfying campaign content discounted may decent purchase make mind whether want see crytek achieved crysis,Crysis to play.

"It's tough to talk about this after having played 2, but here goes.  I enjoyed this game enough when I first played it. Some of the later levels get tough, and there are really only a few viable traps/weapon combos, but it works out. There isn't a lot that I would say is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, which is more than I can say for 2, but there also isn't much challenge, either. Nightmare mode isn't necessarily hard, it just removes the strategy part of the game. You're not given time to think/analyze/change placements, really. I mean, yeah, that's hard, but it's also not really upping the difficulty in anyway. Of course, maybe that's the best way to increase difficulty in a strategy game: removing much chance to strategize.  There is, believe it or not, a story to this game. I wasn't really aware of it for a while, but it's totally there and you might miss it if you're not paying attention.  One quip I have is that things get redundant quickly, but whatcha gon' do.  It's an alright game, good even, if a little stale/boring/dry at times. Like I've indicated elsewhere, though, Two is an improvement in every way, from the interface to map design. The addition of co-op was a much needed boost to OMD as well.  If you skip this one you're not necessarily missing much. A lot of the traps/dialogue/maps are carried over into two.

"This game is a simulator not just a traditional shooter,The full experience of the game Lies in its multiplayer that although does have many game types and modes to choose from,nothing beats 'Tactical Realism' based modes . Thats where the game shines, where team work is required every step of the way to complete a common goal. There are clans that host Organized combat events, where you get the full deal with ranks and comanders feeding down orders through the chain of command, I've played with a few of these realism clans like the 7Cav, 77Jaysowk and i've even played in one of the public events of the 'SOF' Clan and plenty more i cant seem to remember off the top of my head, the arma 3 Community in general is a very warm and welcoming one as i saw during my participation with the people in these clan communites.   No doubt this game isnt for the Average joe, its not about score and killstreaks and action around every corner,  its a simulator and its all about Tactics,Patience,skill and above all Teamwork  P.S. if you're new to this game you'll probably need a program called 'TeamSpeak 3' for multiplayer, its like a virtual radio and we use it for the majority of multiplayer communication",1,game simulator traditional shooterthe full experience game lies multiplayer although many game types modes choose fromnothing beats tactical realism based modes thats game shines team work required every step way complete common goal clans host organized combat events get full deal ranks comanders feeding orders chain command ive played realism clans like cav jaysowk ive even played one public events sof clan plenty cant seem remember top head arma community general warm welcoming one saw participation people clan communites doubt game isnt average joe score killstreaks action around every corner simulator tacticspatienceskill teamwork ps youre new game youll probably need program called teamspeak multiplayer like virtual radio use majority multiplayer communication,a good old fashioned shooter

"Many games set out to be a sandbox--an interactive world filled with options and untapped potential--but Terraria embodies this concept in a way few games do. The game drops you into a 2D pixelated world with a handful of tools and tells you to explore, dig, build, and, oh yeah, survive. Now that the adventure is on consoles, there's one more way to lose hours mining for ore, and you can do it with a friends :)",1,many games set sandboxan interactive world filled options untapped potentialbut terraria embodies concept way games game drops pixelated world handful tools tells explore dig build oh yeah survive adventure consoles theres one way lose hours mining ore friends,can.

"I am never left unimpressed by the things the modding community dreams up. Empires is a well made FPS/RTS with very well made maps, and a well structured open battlefield type gameplay that makes vehicles an integral yet welcome addition to the accomodating maps, while for the most part still leaving a decent amount of gameplay options for the guy who still just wants to run and gun.   The RTS aspect is of a single force commander within a mobile command vehicle. this immediately sets a need for communication and cooperation, as the commander can only establish buildings with the help of his soldiers,   who are playing the game from an FPS point of view and are completing objectives all in real time. It provides a very true to life aspect to battlefield tactics that many are sure to enjoy. The perks system is somewhat rudimentary but still rewarding, and the entire game has a pleasant steampunky feel to it, even providing snippets of a seemingly well thought out backstory.   10/10",1,never left unimpressed things modding community dreams empires well made fpsrts well made maps well structured open battlefield type gameplay makes vehicles integral yet welcome addition accomodating maps part still leaving decent amount gameplay options guy still wants run gun rts aspect single force commander within mobile command vehicle immediately sets need communication cooperation commander establish buildings help soldiers playing game fps point view completing objectives real time provides true life aspect battlefield tactics many sure enjoy perks system somewhat rudimentary still rewarding entire game pleasant steampunky feel even providing snippets seemingly well thought backstory,I have played this game for a long time and I still enjoy it.

"This is objectively the best Ghost Recon game. A completely and utterly unflinching squad tactics title with a plot that's actually  good and comprehensible  for a Tom Clancy game, since it's from an era where the prefix 'Tom Clancy's' meant something.  My view on military shooters is: if you're gonna play a lot of them, you might as well play some that bring home the tension of war and give you an idea of what it might actually entail. Ghost Recon is a wild success in this regard because it is  raw as Hell . One shot, one kill.  You don't even have any weapon viewmodels to look at; presumably because your average special forces operator has drilled enough to regard their weaponry as true extensions of themselves, not worthy of more examination than necessary to clear jams. While this is arguably a negative in the looks department, you don't really play this for the looks. There is mod support that lets you upgrade textures, sounds and other things like that if it really bothers you.  Ghost Recon might need tweaking to get it to run properly, and certainly needs programs like Hamachi to play multiplayer, but if tactical wargames interest you in any way I'd absolutely recommend this and its two expansions to you.",1,objectively best ghost recon game completely utterly unflinching squad tactics title plot thats actually good comprehensible tom clancy game since era prefix tom clancys meant something view military shooters youre gonna play lot might well play bring home tension war give idea might actually entail ghost recon wild success regard raw hell one shot one kill dont even weapon viewmodels look presumably average special forces operator drilled enough regard weaponry true extensions worthy examination necessary clear jams arguably negative looks department dont really play looks mod support lets upgrade textures sounds things like really bothers ghost recon might need tweaking get run properly certainly needs programs like hamachi play multiplayer tactical wargames interest way id absolutely recommend two expansions,Ghost Recon game.
"I recommend this game, but only to diehard Half-Life fans, and even then, that may be a stretch. You see, Blue Shift is actually quite good, remaining synonymous with Half-Life, as far as core gameplay goes. That's just the thing, however - in essence, this game is virtually part of Half-Life 1 reskinned with less weapons, less story, no significant substance added to the Half-Life universe, and only 6 hours max of gameplay in total. While worth the money, and technically in no way bad per se, compared to the original Half-Life, this game just falls short.  But I'm not here to compare this game to HL1, am I? Nope, I'm here to tell you whether or not you should buy this game. So, I'll say this: if you felt that you couldn't get enough of the first Half-Life, then you won't regret purchasing this, the equivalent of a level pack, for five dollars, to get six more hours of Half-Life. Otherwise, look elsewhere; this game brings nothing new other than the maps.",1,recommend game diehard halflife fans even may stretch see blue shift actually quite good remaining synonymous halflife far core gameplay goes thats thing however essence game virtually part halflife reskinned less weapons less story significant substance added halflife universe hours max gameplay total worth money technically way bad per se compared original halflife game falls short im compare game hl nope im tell whether buy game ill say felt couldnt get enough first halflife wont regret purchasing equivalent level pack five dollars get six hours halflife otherwise look elsewhere game brings nothing new maps,Life's 'fun' factor.

"This game caught me by surprise. No really. I had a blast playing this for hours on end, and it's such a unique expperience.   If you ever liked the original Splosion Man, this will give you more of what you like and more. It features a scaling challenge, unique level puzzles and platforming, nd blends them near perfectly. It also has optional stages which really push you to your limit. I know I had a blast with them, and figureing them out. The game throws just enough challenge at you to make you think, but not enough to frustrate you. Every time you die, you'll never blame the game for being unfair. That's the kind of challenge I personally relish.  Plotwise, you're an explosive woman finding an explosive guy. Not really that deep, but it's not like you're playing a visual novel anyway, so the story isn't much of an issue. I like it because it's nice and simple, and never impedes your game. It's got a similar whimsy to your average Mario game, and I use that as a compliment.   Graphically, it's pretty cool. Nice and colorful, but it can contrast with darker themes later in the game. The game certainly has varity, I'll tell you that much.   Musically, it's surprisingly top notch. I expected dubstep or some kind of garbage for hipsters, but the OST is as divrse as the rest of th game. From 50's love serenades to high beat, blood pumping rock chords, and the classic theme with a more pop twist, the game runs the gamut of tunes. My personal favorite is 'Oh Mandy'.   So what's the verdict? This game is fantastic. Buy it on sale if you can, but it's still worth the 10 bucks.",1,game caught surprise really blast playing hours end unique expperience ever liked original splosion man give like features scaling challenge unique level puzzles platforming nd blends near perfectly also optional stages really push limit know blast figureing game throws enough challenge make think enough frustrate every time die youll never blame game unfair thats kind challenge personally relish plotwise youre explosive woman finding explosive guy really deep like youre playing visual novel anyway story isnt much issue like nice simple never impedes game got similar whimsy average mario game use compliment graphically pretty cool nice colorful contrast darker themes later game game certainly varity ill tell much musically surprisingly top notch expected dubstep kind garbage hipsters ost divrse rest th game love serenades high beat blood pumping rock chords classic theme pop twist game runs gamut tunes personal favorite oh mandy whats verdict game fantastic buy sale still worth bucks,I would recommend this game to anyone.

"Gameplay - Bastion is a top-down isometric action game with an emphasis on combat. You can equip two weapons at any given time and add one ability which often uses one of those weapons. With 10+ upgradable weapons and 20+ abilities, you can experiment quite a bit and everyone will find something they like. There are normal levels with enemies and the main story and challenge levels which let you unlock skills and items to help upgrade your weapons. There are also a couple of side modes to help you get more money. As you progress through the game, you also get to rebuild a little town (called Bastion) which adds new places to shop, upgrade weapons, etc. Overall, combat is fast and fun and with short levels, the gameplay will hold your attention throughout the 6-9 hour long story.  Story- Bastion's story is a little weak though you have to play through a lot of the game before you start to realize it. The Kid (the character you control) has no personality and the narrator provides all the informaion to you. The mystery of the story is why the Bastion was destroyed and why the Ura hate you. The game eventually tells you, but it isn't particularly interesting. Playing the side modes like Who Knows Where do help you learn more information about the story and characters if you're interested or just are going for achievements.  Presentation (Graphics and Sound) - The top-down view makes this game pretty unique and the overall art style of the game is pleasing to the eye. The music is great and has songs that really stand out from any other game I've played. The announcer narrates based on your actions like if you kill something you shouldn't or use one weapon a lot, he will make a comment about it. This feature is pretty cool and a nice gimmick. The narrator becomes a little tiring by the end of the game because it seems like he is always saying the same things or saying he doesn't know about things in the story.  Overall Score - Bastion is a fun and relatively short game with plenty of action. It is not too difficult to get all the achievemets in the game as well. While the story was disappointing, I never got tired of running around and killing stuff or upgrading my character, weapons, or the Bastion. This is a fun game and well worth getting when on sale.  8.0",1,gameplay bastion topdown isometric action game emphasis combat equip two weapons given time add one ability often uses one weapons upgradable weapons abilities experiment quite bit everyone find something like normal levels enemies main story challenge levels let unlock skills items help upgrade weapons also couple side modes help get money progress game also get rebuild little town called bastion adds new places shop upgrade weapons etc overall combat fast fun short levels gameplay hold attention throughout hour long story story bastions story little weak though play lot game start realize kid character control personality narrator provides informaion mystery story bastion destroyed ura hate game eventually tells isnt particularly interesting playing side modes like knows help learn information story characters youre interested going achievements presentation graphics sound topdown view makes game pretty unique overall art style game pleasing eye music great songs really stand game ive played announcer narrates based actions like kill something shouldnt use one weapon lot make comment feature pretty cool nice gimmick narrator becomes little tiring end game seems like always saying things saying doesnt know things story overall score bastion fun relatively short game plenty action difficult get achievemets game well story disappointing never got tired running around killing stuff upgrading character weapons bastion fun game well worth getting sale,Weapons.

In the field, you have access to several unit types, each with their own unique weapons and skills. You kill, or capture, aliens while doing a number of other tasks (e.g. escort) and take the information, and corpses, back to your home base. With this info you can research new equipment and abilities. While in your base you'll be able to upgrade units, build new sections of your base, order research tasks, launch satellites, scan the world for alien activity, shoot down UFOs and lots more. There's LOTS of data and information to read, though you are not required to. It is just interesting to read it all, and realize just how much work and imagination the writers and developers put into this game. It's rather amazing.

"Amazingly fun! Starting from the ground up to design the perfect Alien killing squad is tough, but fun. The game is extremely challenging, and will keep you on your toes in order to make sure that all of your squad gets out alive! The game has great replayability and has hours upon hours of enjoyable game play. Even after beating the game, it's fun to keep your file and drop back in to play a couple of missions - as they can still be challenging even with a fully prepared team. The strategy is sound, but there are a few glitches at times - and I have to call BS on the hit % on harder difficulties.  (Once, all 5 of my men missed a target when they all had a 55% chance to hit. The alien had a 45% chance to hit one of my men in cover, and had a 10% to critical. The alien got the critical on one of my men - all of my men missed the alien... and that kind of stuff happened a lot on the harder difficulty)  Even if you're not into turn based strategy games - you should definitely check this game out. It has to be my favorite game that I've purchased on steam thus far.  9/10 - go buy it, you won't regret it :)",1,amazingly fun starting ground design perfect alien killing squad tough fun game extremely challenging keep toes order make sure squad gets alive game great replayability hours upon hours enjoyable game play even beating game fun keep file drop back play couple missions still challenging even fully prepared team strategy sound glitches times call bs hit harder difficulties men missed target chance hit alien chance hit one men cover critical alien got critical one men men missed alien kind stuff happened lot harder difficulty even youre turn based strategy games definitely check game favorite game ive purchased steam thus far go buy wont regret,Alien slayers that are as effective as possible.

Sure XCOM 2 is out already, but I can't help but feel more emotionally in contact with my soldiers in XCOM. The first time I played the final mission, I was also completely blown away by the end mission and the ending of the story.  XCOM 2 has improved on one important factor: randomly generated maps.

"Picked this up in a Steam sale long gone by and really didn't give this the time of day. After TDU2 was in the mood for more mission base driving which CTII does quite nicely. Nice graphics engine and alot of detail in the environment make CTII a pleasure to look at and at 60FPS. Missions are limited to what you can do with a game like this. There are multiple difficulty levels. It's been quite sometime but the game sort of reminds me of Wreckless, the mission based racer for the Xbox. The primary career mode encompasses the exploits of 2 of Germanys finest though there is a Case structure for replayability and picking up past the 1st stage of a multiple stage Case, a welcome feature giving that I've played too many games that make you start from scratch. There is a race mode where you can set up parameter based race events. These include all of the vehicles in the game including semi's which no doubt leave a path of destruction. A great value for the price paid and a fun game.",1,picked steam sale long gone really didnt give time day tdu mood mission base driving ctii quite nicely nice graphics engine alot detail environment make ctii pleasure look fps missions limited game like multiple difficulty levels quite sometime game sort reminds wreckless mission based racer xbox primary career mode encompasses exploits germanys finest though case structure replayability picking past st stage multiple stage case welcome feature giving ive played many games make start scratch race mode set parameter based race events include vehicles game including semis doubt leave path destruction great value price paid fun game,I had played a lot of.

"I've always been a fan of the XCom series, but this is the first one that I've been able to figure out. I attribute that mostly to the existence of a comprehensive tutorial.  Couple hiccups, most notably an intermittent loadout issue. If a soldier isn't on your current team, his equipment sometimes gets stripped and sometimes doesn't. If it doesn't, and that guy is still on active duty, no big. Just load him into the party, take his armor off, then put him back in the bin. If that guy is injured or in the Psy Lab, you can't load him into your party, so any armor or weapons on him are sitting out this mission.  Overall, this game gets a grade of A-.

"part 2 'Coming summer 2008' :(  BUT DONT WORRY! part two was actually released as an offical cinimatic with REALLY good animation. if your ok with play first and watch later, this game is in my book, a complete series.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1YaC3ngiYs&amp;list=PL963FBBF618092865   Overall, the game is old. Like buggy (no pun intended) old. In order get past the game from crashing you need to set the compadibility mode to XP SP3, then run as admin for the game, this helped from getting to many crashes and was able to play the whole game, to top off the crash bug, you need to open the game in window mode then switch to fullscreen, as the game would crash for me on windows 7 before loading the game.  But with that aside, The game was very nice, the detective mode made things enjoyable, and the gameplay was very smooth when I set it up with my controller using a third party program. Weird thing was the instant death to check point areas and falling even .0001 meter past the maximum high would just declare you dead instead of taking a small chunk of health. but I stomached it. the artistic directions was really good, and the animation was VERY good, except for those low buget moments. If this game got atleast 3 more months to tweak and continued animation and programing. this game would be one of those old school classics that everyone would scream 'give us a sequal'   Sadly, a really good game that didnt get enough time, however, unlike every game that doesnt get a sequal, the developers graced us with part 2 cinematics, so give it a watch when your done playing.",1,part coming summer dont worry part two actually released offical cinimatic really good animation ok play first watch later game book complete series httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvyacngiysamplistplfbbf overall game old like buggy pun intended old order get past game crashing need set compadibility mode xp sp run admin game helped getting many crashes able play whole game top crash bug need open game window mode switch fullscreen game would crash windows loading game aside game nice detective mode made things enjoyable gameplay smooth set controller using third party program weird thing instant death check point areas falling even meter past maximum high would declare dead instead taking small chunk health stomached artistic directions really good animation good except low buget moments game got atleast months tweak continued animation programing game would one old school classics everyone would scream give us sequal sadly really good game didnt get enough time however unlike every game doesnt get sequal developers graced us part cinematics give watch done playing,i will send you the link

"This to me is THE tower defense game, that i compare every other TD to. Now, if that wasn't enough to make you buy this game, here's a bit more in depth analysis:  The real challenge in this game comes from the level design. The large open areas don't give you even grids like 10x10 to build your mazes, instead, they give odds like 8x7 etc. So most of the times i found myself thinking that:'Damn, if i put them this way, i could direct them to that area, but then the damage suffers pretty greatly..'. Most other TD games just give your enemies a pre-determined path, that you put towers alongside of it, and usually one tactic works in every level.  Most TD games i've played give you usually a path of two that the enemies go, in this game, you can create a proper mazes on your own, on most levels. That increases the re-playability a lot, and often i find myself trying some level again just to test out a different strategy.  The towers are pretty basic ones, all with 3 levels. There's the gun tower, flamethrower which acts like 'poison', heavy hitting cannon, laser, slower, air, concussion that does huge damage to land groups, and command tower that increases the money gained from kills/shows stealthed units better. So nothing too deep in that department. But nothing more is even needed. In my opinion this game wuold be too much of a hassle with deeper tower system. Since the levels require thinking.  The levels itself, there are a good amount of them, and dlc's add a lot more. Every level also has different modes like 99 waves, lesser cores (that enemies steal), core's that stay where they're dropped by an enemy that's killed (these are challenging), restrictions that you must complete the level using only lvl1 towers, and many more different challenges.  if you're a fan of TD games, this is one of the must-play game of that genre. Really. I haven't encountered a single bug ever on these 134 hours that i've played this, runs perfectly on win 10.",1,tower defense game compare every td wasnt enough make buy game heres bit depth analysis real challenge game comes level design large open areas dont give even grids like x build mazes instead give odds like x etc times found thinking thatdamn put way could direct area damage suffers pretty greatly td games give enemies predetermined path put towers alongside usually one tactic works every level td games ive played give usually path two enemies go game create proper mazes levels increases replayability lot often find trying level test different strategy towers pretty basic ones levels theres gun tower flamethrower acts like poison heavy hitting cannon laser slower air concussion huge damage land groups command tower increases money gained killsshows stealthed units better nothing deep department nothing even needed opinion game wuold much hassle deeper tower system since levels require thinking levels good amount dlcs add lot every level also different modes like waves lesser cores enemies steal cores stay theyre dropped enemy thats killed challenging restrictions must complete level using lvl towers many different challenges youre fan td games one mustplay game genre really havent encountered single bug ever hours ive played runs perfectly win,"- the game is free, and the game is a great game."

As a single player game Terraria is good. It was probably the surprise of the year in 2011.

It has all the game modes of TF2 (of course) and classes, but it is just a bit more fast paced then tf2. plus there is one thing that they took from TFC to make it into TF2, Grenades! The grenades in this game put a spin on every class,with emp,concussion,caltdrop,emp,and a few more aswell. TFC,even today is such a great game to play,its so fun even without all the new 'unlocks' they put in TF2. Im a hardcore Team Fortress fan and give this game an 11/10. Outstanding in gameplay and combat,a must have for any fan of Team Fortress.",1,tfc started trend tf know today say game amazing game modes tf course classes bit fast paced tf plus one thing took tfc make tf grenades grenades game put spin every classwith empconcussioncaltdropempand aswell tfceven today great game playits fun even without new unlocks put tf im hardcore team fortress fan give game outstanding gameplay combata must fan team fortress,I've played it for a long time and I still play it.

"...They will burn me for this one...  So, uh, ...I kind of hate this game... The story missions are just...so...ungodly boring or repetitive. If it's not going from one side of the country to the other, it's going from one side of the country to the other under a time limit. Needless to say at times missions do have diversity, but in nearly every single one there is a transition stage; first you get to the mission then normally you'll be sent to drive off to the objective. On the outside this is no huge issue, i mean of course you gotta go there, but in San Andreas the length to which to get to some certain places just starts getting larger and larger.   What really becomes a problem, for me anyways, is how in these moments mission failure is still a possiblity-- of course it is. But in a game like this, the slightest wrong move can put you underfire or in a danger state, wether the physics bugger up and you flip a car just by simply turning and a npc inside wasnt smart enough to leave, or maybe you needed that car in specific because a character owned it or other small reasons it all leaves you to sit and go back to the start of the mission just to get to that part.  This, all in all, becomes a huge turn off for me because the missions themselves arn't catching my personal interest enough to warrent me wasting so much time after one failure. There are missions in this game that have you start, as ive mentioned, on one side of the map, then have you go all the way to the other. I don't mind ♥♥♥♥ing up and starting over, however, what I do mind is not being able to restart from around where I died. So in many instances, I could and have failed causing me to respawn (without all my items now) thousands of miles away from the mission to which then I will have to drive all the back for the sake of the mission itself.  I can't even restart from the begining of the mission.  Grand Theft Auto IV fixed this by having your phone give you a pop up asking if you wanted to restart, and would put you at the begining of the mission. But in San Andreas, it is so repetative, it is such an ungodly time waste I can't maintain any sense of interest to even continue playing the missions.  This is seriously a huge problem for me, and I dont want to keep pushing forward to retry missions I already have no interest in if it means I have to do nothing but waste time over and over again.  No Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, I am not entertained. Now if you will step aside I am going to punch in some cheat codes which will allow me to fly a dune buggy across the sky into (Not) Las Vegas in a clown suit while im being chased by hookers weilding ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as weapons.  Because that's the part we (Or at least I) remember from GTA: San Andreas.",-1,burn one uh kind hate game story missions justsoungodly boring repetitive going one side country going one side country time limit needless say times missions diversity nearly every single one transition stage first get mission normally youll sent drive objective outside huge issue mean course gotta go san andreas length get certain places starts getting larger larger really becomes problem anyways moments mission failure still possiblity course game like slightest wrong move put underfire danger state wether physics bugger flip car simply turning npc inside wasnt smart enough leave maybe needed car specific character owned small reasons leaves sit go back start mission get part becomes huge turn missions arnt catching personal interest enough warrent wasting much time one failure missions game start ive mentioned one side map go way dont mind ing starting however mind able restart around died many instances could failed causing respawn without items thousands miles away mission drive back sake mission cant even restart begining mission grand theft auto iv fixed phone give pop asking wanted restart would put begining mission san andreas repetative ungodly time waste cant maintain sense interest even continue playing missions seriously huge problem dont want keep pushing forward retry missions already interest means nothing waste time grand theft auto san andreas entertained step aside going punch cheat codes allow fly dune buggy across sky las vegas clown suit im chased hookers weilding weapons thats part least remember gta san andreas,"I'm not sure if I'm a fan of the series or not, but I'm not a fan of the story."

When GFWL closing was announced the devs posted in the forums for this game that they were aware and were looking into it. They've not bothered.

"Pros: This game isn't just another FPS, which seems to be every other game these days. It has a really cool concept that makes it unique, and it utilizes a parkour theme throughout the game. It was a cool experience and overall refreshing.  Cons: The story felt weak. And when you have a single player game, the story is kiiiind of important, so it sucked that it wasn't very enthralling. It also only took me about 5 hours to playthrough. If I had paid the original price for this game I would've been furious. The game can also be very picky about what you can and cannot do. If I wasn't lined up absolutely perfectly with some objects, it wouldn't let me grab them. Lastly, it was kind of easy to get lost. Even with help and highlighted objects, I still found myself at a dead end from time to time.   Overall: 6/10",-1,pros game isnt another fps seems every game days really cool concept makes unique utilizes parkour theme throughout game cool experience overall refreshing cons story felt weak single player game story kiiiind important sucked wasnt enthralling also took hours playthrough paid original price game wouldve furious game also picky cannot wasnt lined absolutely perfectly objects wouldnt let grab lastly kind easy get lost even help highlighted objects still found dead end time time overall,"slick and polished engine that makes it look and play great.

"My Rating: 3/10  The story was okay,but was a bit made up as you go. This is my first Zeboyd game, and I have heard they are not always set in a realm of seriousness.  The game appealed to me at first because of it's Dragon Questesque appearance. Admittedly, I did enjoy it starting out, but the more time I put into it, the more tedious everything became. Battles were boring, the maps were unimaginative and very movement restrictive, and the towns seemed to serve no purpose other than a place to get mana and shop. (Villager commentary was mostly useless.) I just wanted it to end. I only beat it because I was near the end and didn't want it to end up as 'just another game I haven't finished.'  The game was not entirely faulty. I did enjoy the skill system, it made you think about your play style and what skills may be more beneficial in the long run. Also, as much as I dreaded random encounters, boss battles were fun, requiring quick thinking to take down the boss before his strength multiplier became too high.  I personally believe that there are better games out there, but if you want an RPG to play that is cheap (especially on sale, think I got this and Cthulu as a bundle for less than two bucks,) then give it a shot, but be forewarned; unless you like grindy and unnecessarily long dungeons, look elsewhere.",-1,rating story okaybut bit made go first zeboyd game heard always set realm seriousness game appealed first dragon questesque appearance admittedly enjoy starting time put tedious everything became battles boring maps unimaginative movement restrictive towns seemed serve purpose place get mana shop villager commentary mostly useless wanted end beat near end didnt want end another game havent finished game entirely faulty enjoy skill system made think play style skills may beneficial long run also much dreaded random encounters boss battles fun requiring quick thinking take boss strength multiplier became high personally believe better games want rpg play cheap especially sale think got cthulu bundle less two bucks give shot forewarned unless like grindy unnecessarily long dungeons look elsewhere,"spooky place.

"To their credit, when Monolith was tasked with making a Lord of the Rings MOBA they didn’t just re-skin League of Legends and call it a day. Though in hindsight, perhaps that would have been the better choice. For the uninitiated, a MOBA (generally) involves two teams of five players trying to take an opposing base. Minions flow along “lanes”, used as meatshields against enemy defensive towers. You control a powerful hero with potent abilities that level up during the course of the match.   There are a lot of elements that separates GOME from its genre-brothers. Instead of having an in-match store, you purchase all your items, abilities and potions between matches using currency earned during a match. Potions are consumable buffs that need to be restocked. Abilities are utility spells, you can take four into a match. Guardian Belts hold purchasable Relics and Gems (which act like the weapon/armour items from other MOBA games). As your Guardian gains levels during a match, the belt slots unlock from left to right, unlocking the stats of the gems/relics as you go. You can upgrade the Towers that defend your lanes, and the Barracks that spew out minions. Both have four levels of upgrades that drastically improve their defensive/offensive power, giving that lane a huge advantage of a non-upgraded lane. Guardian abilities all work off cooldown counters, there are no mana or resource systems of any kind.  The 36 Guardians are grouped into distinct roles: Tacticians (tanky pushers), Enchanters (high-damage nukers), Defenders (tanky supports), Strikers (glass-cannon nukers) and Warriors (middle-of-the-road). There’s cooperative play against bots, the standard five vs five online play (which puts you in a hard botmatch if it can’t find opponents), survival (five players vs waves of creatures), and a practice mode where you’re forced to play a certain character. There’s only one map, with either three or one lanes, but the map has multiple skins that change the aesthetic trimmings, chosen at random when starting.   You have to pay for the game upfront, but unless you shell out for the expensive edition you only have a handful of Guardians at your disposal. The rest you buy using in-game currency, but the amount you have to play to unlock even one is ridiculous. Online, the game uses a peer-to-peer system for multiplayer instead of a server-based system, so expect a lot of lag all the time. That’s if you can even find a match:  steamcharts.com  which tracks players on Steam games reports GOME has at most, 20-30 people online at any time. Range indicators on abilities are unreliable, controls can be unresponsive, and you can’t even adjust the graphics settings in-game.  Proving that the power of a franchise name alone isn’t enough to save a bad game, Guardians of Middle-earth is a derelict wreck. Its online community is dead, and even if you’re okay with just playing offline against bots, the core game experience is a let down.",-1,credit monolith tasked making lord rings moba didnt reskin league legends call day though hindsight perhaps would better choice uninitiated moba generally involves two teams five players trying take opposing base minions flow along lanes used meatshields enemy defensive towers control powerful hero potent abilities level course match lot elements separates gome genrebrothers instead inmatch store purchase items abilities potions matches using currency earned match potions consumable buffs need restocked abilities utility spells take four match guardian belts hold purchasable relics gems act like weaponarmour items moba games guardian gains levels match belt slots unlock left right unlocking stats gemsrelics go upgrade towers defend lanes barracks spew minions four levels upgrades drastically improve defensiveoffensive power giving lane huge advantage nonupgraded lane guardian abilities work cooldown counters mana resource systems kind guardians grouped distinct roles tacticians tanky pushers enchanters highdamage nukers defenders tanky supports strikers glasscannon nukers warriors middleoftheroad theres cooperative play bots standard five vs five online play puts hard botmatch cant find opponents survival five players vs waves creatures practice mode youre forced play certain character theres one map either three one lanes map multiple skins change aesthetic trimmings chosen random starting pay game upfront unless shell expensive edition handful guardians disposal rest buy using ingame currency amount play unlock even one ridiculous online game uses peertopeer system multiplayer instead serverbased system expect lot lag time thats even find match steamchartscom tracks players steam games reports gome people online time range indicators abilities unreliable controls unresponsive cant even adjust graphics settings ingame proving power franchise name alone isnt enough save bad game guardians middleearth derelict wreck online community dead even youre okay playing offline bots core game experience let,"The game is a bit of a letdown, but it’s still a lot of fun."
Sad this game was once somthing awsome 6 player zombie slaughter of fun. Then came the disgusting over priced character packs for 1 new player 5$ a pop just because it has a new voice actor. But wait they went farther with a gold wepons skin pack that says hey look at me these guns have no diffrent stats from your's but I can afford this pack for 5$ and you cant also the wepons appear in your wepon store even if you dont own it and make it harder to find the wepon you want in time. Now if you have managed to read all of this and think huh they cant mess up the game more your wrong. Before the dumb pay to win update you max level for a class was 5 took for ever to reach I might add they then decided to raise it to 10 when I stoped playing.

"Bought this game after getting an itch for a new RPG. A lot of the game reminded me of Dark Souls, since the combat was pretty unforgiving and required precise timing. You cannot hack and slash your way through the game, which I liked.   However, if a game is going to be unforgiving, I am going to be the same way towards its polish. KoA has some pretty bad camera work that make timing the perfect dodge or counter attack near impossible once an enemy dashes behind you. The direction your character attacks is also subject to this issue. Spent far longer than I should have on some fights purely because the camera disagreed with me all too regularly.  The quests have the depth of your average MMO (go kill X enemy type, fetch Y item for me). I simply ran out of reasons to push forward through the game and was too frustrated by its problems.  The game also doesn't come with any options menu of any depth, if that's important to you. It feels very much like a mediocre (but not terrible) console port.  Unless you have a strong desire for a tough RPG, I would stay away. If you happen to really love those types of games, you may be able to push through the issues.",-1,bought game getting itch new rpg lot game reminded dark souls since combat pretty unforgiving required precise timing cannot hack slash way game liked however game going unforgiving going way towards polish koa pretty bad camera work make timing perfect dodge counter attack near impossible enemy dashes behind direction character attacks also subject issue spent far longer fights purely camera disagreed regularly quests depth average mmo go kill x enemy type fetch item simply ran reasons push forward game frustrated problems game also doesnt come options menu depth thats important feels much like mediocre terrible console port unless strong desire tough rpg would stay away happen really love types games may able push issues,"I'm a huge fan of the series, and I'm glad I finally got to play it.

"It's a mediocre turn based strategy game.  XCOM: Enemy Unkown/Enemy Within is a dumbed down turn based strategy game.

"After playing this game for 1 year, I can honestly say that I am sick of it. In the beginning, I really enjoyed the game, simply for the fact that it was basically an online version of GTA (open world, stealing pedestrian cars, shooting, third person, etc). The customization in the game was what also kept me drawn to it (also because it is a third person shooter). The amount of detail you can put on your character was like no other F2P game that I have played. Plus you have the ability to create unique custom symbols, themes, songs and car designs. The gameplay is also pretty good. The missions are standard (pick up items, guard items, capture and hold the base/item). It's kinda cool how even though you are in a mission, you are still in the open world and still able to interact with others outside the game (like you don't have to go in a game room and have private matches). But it also gets annoying to deal with grievers and having players run into each other.   Of course with any PVP game, you will have players who are more skilled in the game than others. That's the reason for the player threat level (Bronze, Silver and Gold). There are districts for each of these levels, but of course players choose to play in the lowest district threat as they could (Gold players in Silver district and Silver players in Bronze district). I'm not complaining though because I am just as guilty of this (we all like to feel pro ^^). The weapons in the game however can be unbalanced. Those who choose to purchase G1C have the fortune of obtaining the latest (and most garbage looking reskins remade with some percs) weapons. But that's nothing new. Every game has it's share of P2W.  What I hated most about this game was the community. I haven't played much online games in general, but with the few that I have, it does not compare to the level of displeasure as APB.Of course with any online game, you get your share of trolls, douches and jerks; but this game somewhat gives the advantage to these people (for example: following you around with a car to grieve you, ghost your missions, or sit on top of mission items to purposely make you lose a mission). Not to mention if you are having some luck on a day and do exceptionally well in your matches, you are then insulted and accused of hacking. In opposition to that, if you do poorly you are also ridiculed for playing as an amateur and labelled as a 'noob' or 'scrub'. So no matter how good or bad you are at this game, you will face some form of harassment.  So like I said, I have developed an extreme dislike for this game. Or maybe I've been playing it for too long and finally become sick of it. It's still a fun game, even if it has it's MAJOR flaws.",-1,playing game year honestly say sick beginning really enjoyed game simply fact basically online version gta open world stealing pedestrian cars shooting third person etc customization game also kept drawn also third person shooter amount detail put character like fp game played plus ability create unique custom symbols themes songs car designs gameplay also pretty good missions standard pick items guard items capture hold baseitem kinda cool even though mission still open world still able interact others outside game like dont go game room private matches also gets annoying deal grievers players run course pvp game players skilled game others thats reason player threat level bronze silver gold districts levels course players choose play lowest district threat could gold players silver district silver players bronze district im complaining though guilty like feel pro weapons game however unbalanced choose purchase gc fortune obtaining latest garbage looking reskins remade percs weapons thats nothing new every game share pw hated game community havent played much online games general compare level displeasure apbof course online game get share trolls douches jerks game somewhat gives advantage people example following around car grieve ghost missions sit top mission items purposely make lose mission mention luck day exceptionally well matches insulted accused hacking opposition poorly also ridiculed playing amateur labelled noob scrub matter good bad game face form harassment like said developed extreme dislike game maybe ive playing long finally become sick still fun game even major flaws,"I Love You.

"Oh god, I remember first finding out about this game while it was being made for a competition on TIGsource. It was great fun, and I suppose it still is, but after a while of not playing it and coming back to see so many changes, It has definitely taken a turn for the worst.  The basic premise of the game is pretty much a multiplayer 'bullet hell' style game, most of the action (PvE) takes place on a randomly generated continent which is really big and possesses many diverse environments. This means that there's not a shortage of bosses and mooks to kill, and temples and castles to raid for loot. The item system is pretty easy to understand, with gear being divided on tiers, a higher tier meaning rarer and more powerful items.   Initially, you are made to choose a class and dropped off in a tutorial with only a basic weapon and a skill item. The game itself is pretty fun, and you can play for hours without it getting boring or repetitive. Here's where the game starts falling apart. Most of the action that happens later is just plain old grinding. Even for the hardest monsters getting item drops is really hard, as the item drop rate is extremely tiny.  The worst thing that's happened to this game was the developers being bought by Kabam. It has pretty much become a pay-to-win affair. Before, you could buy cosmetic items and pets with real money to support the developers. Now you can get the rarest armours and weapons with a few bucks. Like I said before, the item drop rates are ridiculous, so selling weapons and items for real money feels kind of cheap.  All in all, a good game ruined by 'freemium'. If you play it, expect to grind a lot, or pay up.",-1,oh god remember first finding game made competition tigsource great fun suppose still playing coming back see many changes definitely taken turn worst basic premise game pretty much multiplayer bullet hell style game action pve takes place randomly generated continent really big possesses many diverse environments means theres shortage bosses mooks kill temples castles raid loot item system pretty easy understand gear divided tiers higher tier meaning rarer powerful items initially made choose class dropped tutorial basic weapon skill item game pretty fun play hours without getting boring repetitive heres game starts falling apart action happens later plain old grinding even hardest monsters getting item drops really hard item drop rate extremely tiny worst thing thats happened game developers bought kabam pretty much become paytowin affair could buy cosmetic items pets real money support developers get rarest armours weapons bucks like said item drop rates ridiculous selling weapons items real money feels kind cheap good game ruined freemium play expect grind lot pay,I got tired of it.

"Hooray this game is on sale that means that I should buy it, right? Wrong, (at least for people with the same opinion as me) I have never played a game that does not know what it wants to be as much as Wolfenstein: The New Order.   This is a pinnacle of gaming development, because they managed to jam so many stupid things in this game.... Do you love walking around aimlessly in underground tunnels? What about a worse romance plot since Twilight? Do you like killing people that look like robots that just happen to be Nazis?   This game had one job, to make a hero that is over powered so that he could be a crude son of a gun, while he kills literally thousands of crazy Germans... but they let you sneak, and sometimes you have to, cause you are not the unbeatable person that you might imply that the game would make you. You suck and can die easily but have the personality of someone with the powers of Thor...  Your quests will range from everything from rescue some Jewish technology to help a mentally challenged person find toys... ugh this game just makes me let out one giant sigh...  I do not blame you for looking to buy this game, it looks really appealing, but it is so lost in plot direction and character development. I will not say that this is glitchy or not well developed, but everything quests, characters, enemies and all of the action is just unpleasantly messy  I forgot to mention the vast amount of quality cut scenes, that are not even needed in the slightest.... everything in this game has no flow. There are like fourteen games in one... in a bad way  Yes the game does have it's good parts, shooting is fun and the game most of the game looks exceptional.

"This game originally failed because of core problems that existed in the game and the complete ineptitude of the developers (when they were Real Time Worlds) to fix or at the very least alleviate these problems.  Now on top of those issues you have an utterly broken cash shop system that will ruin your experience 95% of the time.  To start I should address some of the original problems that plagued the game on it's original releaes, guns were (and still are) terrible to use and the application of modifications does not make that any better. The gunplay feels clunky and the recoil on most weapons make it impossible to hit anything less than 5 feet infront of you. that is unless you use specifc weapons.  Cars are in the same boat as guns, for a cops and robbers MMO, you think they would be able to get the driving down. This is not the case. The car physics are terrible and they don't control that great either.  The mission system is absolute garbage, you can follow through multiple objectives, winning one after another. but if you fail the final one (, you will instantly, ignoring the fact taht you and your side were dominating the opposition;; fail the entire mission (And I find this happens more for the enforcer faction than the criminal faction, in all my time playing). This is further problematic with the addition cash shop weapons.  Now your thinking: Wow, hopefully the new developer and publishers would of picked up this game up and would of tried to fix these issues, which while do not make the game unplayable, do not provide an enjoyable experience for prolonged periods of time.  Well, no. They ignored these issues.  And I haven't even mentioned the games instability, poor performance even with modern hardware. or the failure for the game to completely shut-down once your done playing (One of the processes used in the game will ALWAYS STAY UP).  What they did bring to the game. was one of the worst things they could of done. They added a cash shop for guns, no no, not cosmetics. these guns have an actual performance advantage over other guns that you can actually aquire through gameplay.  These wonderful items provide superior damage, little to no recoil in addition to some other effects they can provide.  This damages the poor mission matchmaking and balancing because if your enemy team has these weapons, and you don't well, your screwed. in laymans terms.  Now to be fair, the new devs have actually added some content in the game with the addition of the 'Chaos district' and in game events. These aren't that great though, they aren't even the quality of the RTW content (Which isn't that great either), and the events are hampered by people rampantly cheating. Which I forgot to mention, is incredibly commonin this game (from outright use of hacks, to exploiting faults with the game or going out of bounds.)  the only positive thing I can say about the game is it's customisation system. and, unfortunately ,that hasn't seen any improvements since release of the ORIGNAL release. There is very little added to customise yourself since then (that that which is added is cash shop items -- go figure.) and while the emblem creator is nice and all that, if you don't have the ability to use it (since you cannot import emblems and pictures, you use geometric shapes to create them) thats just a wasted feature, and you will be dependant on the auction house to find anything you want. Which is ALSO an issue since people find it prudent to sell their crap for stupid huge amounts of money, and you can't filter or search by name of what your looking for. so if you want anything past 'T' for example. be prepared for LE EPIC TROLL FACE MEME XDDD!!! for the next 40 pages.  To sum this up: If your looking for a GTA MMO, this isn't that. go play GTA instead, if your looking for a fun Free-to-Play game, this Definitely isn't for you. becuase this game is by no means 'Free' and it's not fun either. I tried to cover everything I experience in my time playing this game, I probably missed something that would make me go for another 5 paragraphs. so it's best to stop here.

"It's a shame really,    This game, judging by the screen shots, looked quite promising. However, it is let down frequently from the start by annoying and sometimes unnecessary development choices. If you are a fan of the invisible wall, you are in luck. The developer, Spark Unlimited, almost certainly blew half their budget on them. They are implemented in a ' wait and see what we have to show you ' way. Fine, if you are building the up the story at a slow pace, and if obscured by scenery. However, the first ten minuets of the game are riddled with them, stopping you dead in your tracks in open space. They funnel you down certain paths to heighten the action and drama, but it's use is so sloppy that you will almost certainly be left more frustrated that captured by the environment.   The invisible walls will be placed in front of a small jump-able obstacle and open areas, or more often than not, dead in front of you so you physically stop to look at a set piece fall or some other mundane event. This is most noticeable in the beginning scene where you are told to flee from danger, only to be stopped ever 5 steps to watch the danger play out in front of you, while you stand their like a confused child. If you are expecting the sort of interactive storytelling more commonly associated with, Say, Half Life 2. You are out of luck.   The opening scenes are a little like the beginning of Darksiders. Humans fleeing from winged monsters destroying a city around you. However, instead of capturing the excitement and joy that Darksiders offers, Legendarys offerings are much more hilarious. I laughed, audibly, when the ' Mexican Wave ' happened outside the museum.   The hero of this game is, as in most FPS games, silent. But to make him seem more human and relatable, the developers applied Playstation 2 era facial animations to him. He is so convincing, his face slowly sliding into every expression known to man, that you will swear he has some form of medical condition. In fact, his appearance was so poorly handled I was sure the game was setting up the main villain.    To round this all off, once I acquired my first weapon I attempted to use it against the nearest enemy. But the axe just passed straight through it, over and over. The game was too busy showing me all the fun that I wouldn't be having.    The game feels unfinished, unpolished and linier. A cheap experience.

"I played through this game after completing the first part in the series and I have to say that I am somewhat disapointed with the game in several ways that I will list down below.  1) In the original game the crossbow was your bread and butter, the game was really a blend of true TPS and TD but I feel like actual marksmanship has been removed from the game. Projectiles fly off in random directions unless a special focus has been met making the use of the crossbow highly impractical compared to the first game.  2) Throughout the game you are reminded that you need to farm skulls in endless mode in order to beef up your traps so you can proceed in the campaign. Granted that it is still possible to complete the campaign levels without dowing this, if you want to play the game solo then it is impossible to get perfect scores in certain levels without farming up a bit.  3) The heavy emphasis on coop play shows in the level designs, while most stages are perfectly doable on your own it is sometimes extremely difficult to work around in later stages.  4) The original game had Weavers, certain skill trees you could use in a stage to enhance certain aspect of your character or traps, this has been completly removed from the game in favor of upgrading individual traps and weapons using skulls.  5) Last but certainly not least: This game has a terrible amount of bugs. It crashes frequently upon completing stages giving you the strange state where you have unlocked the next stage but have no registered high score. While playing coop (something this game has seemingly been designed around) the game has even more oppertunities to crash making it really frustrating when you have finally gotton to one of those later waves in a stage only to see your work amount to nothing.  Now for nuance it seems like that game has a somewhat more involved story line that still has a big open ending and playing as the new character class was quite an enjoyable experience.  My final verdict is that if you are really looking for a game that you can casually play with friends during LAN events or get togethers that this game can be a nice fix. If you haven't played this series before and are more inclined to play solo anyway I highly recommend to get part 1 instead. If you have already bought and or played part 1 then I am not really comfortable really recommending this one.  I hope the devs get around to fixing some of the bugs in this game to make it a more stable experience.

"Legendary is a legendary pile of garbage.   First off, let me say that the video on the store page trying to depict this game as some sort of carfullky nurtured game with developers that are passionate about how 'epic' this game looks is a complete lie. This game is a march past setpiece after setpiece not unlike COD in its complete lack of choice in game design. The game has you walking down linear hallways around 90% of the game, which can be fine for a game, but when I am in a large open area and the places that I can walk are defined by wrecked cars, it is obvious the game developers are fairly bad level designers.  The combat design is just about as abysmal as the level design, being monotonous and boring solely because of the lack of content in this area. There are really ony a few enemies for the first 3 hours of the game, some being monsters and some being human. There is also a complete lack of imagination in the weapon choice, leaving battles to never feel unique or even necessary. The monster enemies drop energy that you can absorb in order to execute powers like healing and pushing enemies back just like in Bioshock, which seems like a neat mechanic, but it basically boils down to an extra health bar or in a situation were you need to 'Charge something up' the way to advance the mission. One of the biggest issues is that the human enemies do somewhat unavoidable hitscan damage that can drain your healthbar quickly, but then they do not yield any energy to restore your health when they die. This forces these parts of the game to be a grind of memorizing where all the enemies are hiding behind cover and making sure you are not shot.  I could forgive most of these complaint and just leave it under 'The budget was too small' or some other likely excuse, but the game has a nasty habit of just plain wasting your time. I like to call these AGOs, or Artificial Game Lengtheners. It's things that are put in to games like Legendary in order to make up for the lack of actual gameplay time and pad out the game length. Some of the feature AGOs in Legendary include: doors that take 10 seconds to open popping up very often in a level, breaking platform making you fall to a lower place to do a section of platforming again, and long enemy gauntlets while you are waiting for one of you allies to 'fix' the device of the moment a la Half-Life 2. Overall, it gives the game an air of unfinishedness, knowing these things were probably added to make the pitifully short game just a bit longer.   Overall, this game is just an unispired mess. It riffs of so many other games that you wonder if the developers had an original thought in mind for the whole game. It tries to be Bioshock, Half-Life 2, Crysis 2, and Fear all at once and doesn't understand that many of the gameplay elements in each of these games were used to accomplish a certain purpose: a purpose that is lacking in Legendary. Don't buy this game unless you want to study what NOT to do in a shooter, because this isn't fun in any sense of the word.

"  To be honest, for a five hours to complete game its not that bad for a 2$ game, or 50 cents if you get this on sale.  Unfortunately, the description is kind of a lie.  I was not thinking at all about Yoshi's Island while playing this, granted there might be some similarities due to it being a 2D platformer, and the fact that you have to go through all the levels of the game. The reason is because yoshi's Island was at best a platformer to anything else, and was loved by gamers because of its classic artstyle and the challenge that was always looming around.  Also, there were boss stages, which unlike in this game, where while it seemed to have built up to a boss it actually wasn't, and it just add more to how there is a lack of any tension to your journey. Really you're just strolling about and at best nobody would ever need to even check a walkthrough because the game is too simple with how you collect items, as secrets are pretty obvious.  That being said I'll give to the devs credit that the physics are definetly impressive and at times I was genuinely impressed with the possiblities they made with them. Sadly, the said potential is kind of locked for the current stage, and the mechanics are different for each of the four stages, basically giving you something new to work with only to be quickly abandoned. It's quite pointless if you ask me.  As for the 'hardcore', the only part that was a challenge was the last stage, only because there are no checkpoints where it feels like there should be, and I'm pretty sure its where you'd probably quit the game by that point, especially since up to this point the game was fair enough in its challenge, only to bombard you with tiny careful jumps along with deadly fall right at the end.  In addition, the only other difficult part is that sometimes puzzles become unbeatable because you might end up accidently throwing the blocks you essentialy need out of your reach, which I feel like they haven't thought it through, and it shows.  That being said, the story is not entirely bad (but sure as heck disappointing) and the graphics are fairly decent for an indie game...Too bad the game already crashed to me once (I think) and at some points did in fact got some major lag for such a minium req. game, and my PC isn't even high-end at best but can still run much bigger games which is why I assume the lag is on the dev's end, plus whenever a certain enemy explodes it seems to almost tear space and time as it glitches into black boxes everywhere...  But hey, if you want to waste 5 hours and dont mind wasting less than a dollar on sale go for it, although if you want to at least seem like you have a decent library of games on your steam account, then you should probably skip this, it's not really worth it.  On a quick note I checked one of the dev's blog. If you absolutely hate clifhangers then yeah stay away from this game.

"I really wanted to get through this game, I really did. The story had enough mystery about it to keep me interested but the combat is just awful. Ammo is relativly scarce for a good while and every single enemy you have to hit with a continuous from your flashlight to break their shield before you can do any damage to them. I didn't get that far but from what I saw there are two enemies. First is the weak one that takes three rounds to kill. They run at you and chuck objects. Then there are larger guys that walk slower and take six shots to kill. If it were all the latter the game would be more enjoyable but they send the small enemies en masse and every time you get hit your flashlight goes off target and just as you regain balance, here comes more garbage flying at you. The enemies are position activated so there is no sneaking past either. I turned around to see the entire chapter coming at me. The camera positioning is a bit off too and when you 'boost' your flashlight, targets and backround become kind of indistinguishable.

"Every now and then i buy an old classic that i missed at the time in the hope it will still kick ♥♥♥ today. You win some, you lose some. I remember loving the ads for this game. Hearing all those great tunes and watching your guy drive around in a Ferrari like Sonny Crocket was magical. Unfortunately, after almost 12 years of anticipation, i realize the actual gameplay isn't.  I think the biggest problem is that it is a console game. The save system is absolutely abysmal. You need to drive 5 minutes to some out-of-the way checkpoint to save, then you need to spend another 5 minutes driving back to the guy who gives you your mission, then your mission sends you 5 minutes driving somewhere else, then if you die on your mission, you are forced to repeat 10+ minutes of garbage time just to get where you were when the action started. This would have been bad enough in 2001, but in 2015 when there are thousands of other games on Steam it's unforgivable. Woeful checkpoint system aside, the mouselook is really jerky and it's almost impossible to aim your guns or fight on foot. Pretty much the only thing that rocks in this game is driving around aimlessly in a Ferrari listening to synthpop, and then i might as well just be watching Miami Vice in the first place.",-1,every buy old classic missed time hope still kick today win lose remember loving ads game hearing great tunes watching guy drive around ferrari like sonny crocket magical unfortunately almost years anticipation realize actual gameplay isnt think biggest problem console game save system absolutely abysmal need drive minutes outofthe way checkpoint save need spend another minutes driving back guy gives mission mission sends minutes driving somewhere else die mission forced repeat minutes garbage time get action started would bad enough thousands games steam unforgivable woeful checkpoint system aside mouselook really jerky almost impossible aim guns fight foot pretty much thing rocks game driving around aimlessly ferrari listening synthpop might well watching miami vice first place,&quot;The &quot;

"Larva Mortus is a top-down shooter. You go from room to room killing everything with up to eight different weapons. You can level up your stats, play through tons of levels, or you could just play something else.  The biggest problem with LM is that the difficulty is unbalanced. When you select your difficult setting, you're actually deciding on how much you want to be annoyed. This game features a lot of small enemies, some that leave trails of fire everywhere, spit multiple projectiles, and even randomly become invincible. The harder difficulties mean you have to put up with more of their crap, blow through all of your ammo, and possibly get killed in the process. The easiest setting seems like the best choice, since all difficulty really affects is how much the player does and takes damage. However, this setting also makes the game too easy...which I guess is to be expected...hm. Regardless, the alternative is pointless frustration.  Insta-death also starts to become a common theme later in the game. Devils and Champion Knights have attacks that'll kill you regardless of health or difficulty. Circle-strafing is a good method of avoiding this deadly attack, but these jerks tend to attack in groups, and other enemies lending a hand. Still, death really isn't very punishing, unless of course you managed to collect a rare item. There are a number of unique treasures that strengthen the player or offer a big XP bonus. These are lost if you die before completing the stage. Strangely, all of the achievements are tied to these rarities, you don't even get a cheevo for beating the game.  Larva Mortus is just a very dull game. Within 15 minutes you've seen most everything the game has to offer, and yet it just keeps going for hours, without purpose or entertainment value. There are a few moments of satisfaction, like blowing up a half-dozen monsters with a cannon, or shooting a werewolf in the face with a shotgun, but you can get more entertainment from playing a classic FPS like Doom. This game consists of running through rooms, occasionally finding something interesting, sometimes dying, and just never really caring.

"Now, I don't know about you, but besides my love for artsy fartsy and 2deep4u stuff, I enjoy some dumb action and Hollywood homo-eroticism every now and then. And that's exactly what Global Ops: Commando Libya is. Only that it's a bad action movie. In fact, it's so bad that it becomes absolutely hilarious. The homosexual remarks between the protagonist and his companion (who sounds like such a twink that he could only sound more gay if he was drinking Fristi or something), the fact that one of the main bad guys keeps talking about how we will never get his ♥♥♥, the almost insultingly bad accents and so much more. The game itself is gameplay wise a cheaper version of Army of Two with extra genericness, bad dialogue, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Call of Duty-esque storylines and gayness. Lots of it. The best way to have a good time with this game is to buy it cheap (I bought it for 1 key and consider that to be a fair price, considering the campaign takes about 5 hours to beat and MP is dead) and to laugh at all the awul everything. One of my personal favourite things to do was play this game and analyze it like it was all a metaphor for man looking for his partner of the same sex while struggling with the difficulties he faces in such a 'manly' world. The chopper would be a metaphor for his doubts about his sexual orientation, the fat Russian talking about how you will never get his ♥♥♥ would be a metaphor for all the potential sexual relationships with women he is 'throwing away', etc. In other words, it's great fun and the perfect thing to do when you're really bored and want to do something gay that doesn't involve other men or porn. And don't get me wrong. I'm not even against homosexuals or anything, but this game is probably the gayest thing to ever be featured on steam since Gone Home. That's just a fact. In a more serious note on the game itself: it's just extremely generic and since it's developed by a smaller studio, not as polished as generic AAA shooters. It's really the worst of two worlds, sadly. There's plenty of work put into this game, and I can see that, but nobody's interested in a generic shooter like Gonorrhea Flops: Cummando Labia, especially when you compare it to all the creative content smaller studios have created before in the indie scene.

"My review for Half-Life can be seen here:  http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/70   I like to call this game Half-Life: But S.h.i.t. Whats this? A NEGATIVE Half-Life game review? Best to downvote it and not read it. As long as something has Half-Life in the title it can't POSSIBLY be ♥♥♥♥! No. Boring at best and flat out bad at worst Blue Shift has the honor of being Half-Life's red headed step child (No offense to red headed step children.). Many will assume that because it's related to Half-Life it's good or that because it's a expansion much like Opposing Force which is one of the best expansions ever made. Opposing Force was pretty damn good as far as expansions go so this being the Yang to Opposing Forces Yin is disappointing. The only worthwhile thing to come from this was one of the many Barney's getting the last name Calhoun. It has dull puzzles, and uninteresting story that tells nothing new, glitchy physics for NPC's on elevators which was something that both Half-Life Oh, and it has lengthy sewer levels. 'How could something made by Valve be bad?' you say. Opposing Force and But S h i t were made by Gearbox in addition to an often forgotten COOP addon for a PS2 port of Half-Life that was worked on by Gearbox. I don't dislike it because it's by Gearbox as that would be petty but if you are inclined to defend it for the glory of Valve as opposed to based on his own merits than at least you know it wasn't now. Opposing Force is one of the few expansions that was not only great but could stand on it's own. While Opposing Force is non canon dissapointingly all thanks to it's inclusion of aliens called Race X. Meanwhile Blue Shift is canon but that might be because it has no new weapons or aliens. Considering the time and location Shepard arrived at Black Mesa it's not to hard to believe that there may be weapons Gordon didn't find as the HECU related weapons that Shepard would come across weren't very common comapred to the MP5/M4. No new weapons is sort of excusable having played future titles like Half-Life 2: Episode 1 and 2 but considering Opposing Force was probably made by similar people it's ridiculous that they learned nothing and that there was no variety. No Race X? Thats fine. Race X don't fit in with Half-Life's aliens and they and the marines suffered from surprisingly bad AI. In Blue Shift the environments are linear, uninteresting and look really out of place. They are REALLY flat. You have sewers, parking lots, sewers, storage rooms, parking lots, sewers, parking lots and Xen. That's a lot of variety ey? All the puzzles take forever and the peices for them move slow as hell. The combat encounters are also a bore and primarily take place in these afformentioned parking lots which while outdoors don't seem to be part of the facility thanks to poor artistic cohesion. I don't swear often but I must to get to the point and be brash. You are a security gaurd. In Black Mesa. And luckily you are Barney Calhoun out of all of them. Yeah not much is going to happen this should be pretty grounded. Then again this is Black Mesa. Other then the arbitrary showing Black Mesa go to hell during the resonance cascade whats there to show? How many dull ♥♥♥♥ing puzzles can one gaurd survive? I like puzzles so why is this game so bad at them? Where the ♥♥♥♥ are other friendly NPCs and security gaurds after the resonance cascade? You'll see one get killed by zombies and another thrown in a pit but thats all I can recall. Why doesn't Barney talk? The amount of mutes around here is getting out of control. Not only that but if it's canon why is Barney so quiet? If Barney spoke that would really give it some personality. Also I get Barneys resourceful but without the HEV suit or some protective gear he should look like swiss cheese. The story on offer is just so meaningless and worse yet the gameplay is hampered by the awful design. The fact it's version of Xen managed to be WORSE than Xen in Half-Life is amazing. Not to mention he goes to space with nothing but what you see him wearing on the cover. Who needs a space suit when you can hold your breath right? Stay away and buy Opposing Force or Half-Life if you haven't already!

"Experience starting: 1: Toxic, immature playerbase rife with racial slurs and homophobia. 2: Poor balancing. First mission in the starting zone was put right in against two other players one with a grenade launcher. Not a good first experience. 3: There is no actual tutorial, you have to figure out everything for yourself, which is fine except plenty of things don't make any sense. IE you can't shoot at criminals in the midst of a crime spree unless your in their mission even though the game claims you can 'witness criminal activity with alt' to start a mission against them. Lots of unspoken rules, lots of players will lose their minds if you actually complete mission objectives. 4: Driving feels sloppy. 5: Gunplay feels weak. Headshots apprently don't count, certain weapons have so far been abysmal. Shotguns that can't kill beyond 5 feet, pistols that just can't kill even when you sneak around and initiate. Long time to kill makes the game feel like the shooter gameplay is tacked on. 6: All the guns cost money if you want them for more than ten days apparently. 7: Most of the civillians look identical. You basically have a city apparently populated by janitors and hookers who can't blink. 8: Customization has lots of options.  In all I tried to give it a fair shake but it disappointed me at most every turn. Was expecting a fun cops and robbers game where you could jump right into heists as they occur and create scenarios organically. Instead its basically a giant arena game with junky weapons and obscure rules that aren't explained. This is all covered in a festering morass of immature and rude players.

"Not a fan of horror when the main focus of the aspect is random things popping up with ear-screeching music. Also not a fan of the shallowness of the main character.

I know many love the game, but it's definitely not for me. Oh, and the port was horribly done, especially the keyboard and mouse controls. There were times where I had to hit the reload button several times to get the action going...even while standing around and doing absolutely nothing but hitting reload.

"This game looks like a pretty good game when I first saw it. However, as I played, it only turned out to be a decent game. The good things about the game were the trading, co-op missons, online multiplayer, cuztomizations, and classes. The classes were well balanced, the cuztomizations were cool, and the co-op/multiplayer was fun, for a while. The game doesn't have much players playing and respawning takes too long. Connecting to servers took a while and after 5 hours of the game, I kinda got bored of it.

"(Disclaimer: I do probably have nostalgia for the original) It makes me sad to have to not recommend this. I was honestly excited by the idea of the Death Rally game being remade and hopefully expanded. Instead what we seem to have is essentially a mobile game scaled up that has a lot of the words in common with Death Rally but feels like it misses on a few important cylinders.  Death Rally was a half race and half car-carnage game and it pulled it together well though sometimes a bit cheesy. Fun could be had as the races really felt like skill made a big difference and timing your mines and machine gun fire to destroy opponents in your way was rewarding though not trivial. Through the game, you got money which you needed to restock supplies like ammo or armor, upgrade your car a bit or buy new cars/weapons.  This version feels like the dumbed down iOS port that it really is. Money now only is here to buy upgrades to the car and repair it. The upgrades feel like they make almost no difference in gameplay (except armor which did actually seem to prolong life). But as a racing game, getting better cars or engines did not make me feel like I was going faster. I've read that even the best car with the best engine does not go faster than the initial car an opponent drives in a beginner race. It makes the upgrades feel definitely token.  There is also no real money management. In fact, after a race, the game seems to expect you to just spend all of your money since ammo is restocked at the beginning of a race anyway. New weapons and cars are unlocked after collecting a certain number of pieces scattered on tracked on dropped from destroyed opponents. It feels like progression in this game could be substituted for attrition. I remember in the original sometimes being in a bad place because I took a loan I couldn't pay back. This made decisions feel like they meant something. Also, additional objectives in the original again meant something since money mattered. Here, they are a yes/no box you click periodically and see if it works. It feels sometimes like an Office product had a pop up with the title 'Fun' and boxes that just say yes and no appeared with no real context or consequence to the action.  Yes you do advance faster from placing higher, but it still doesn't feel significant enough. After all, winning a race seems to come mostly down to well placed nitro boosts at the end.  The destruction of opponents seems like an area where this could shine. Unfortunately, there are things in the way of allowing you to really get the full enjoyment from the experience. Your base machine gun automatically shoots for you (after you add your 1 additional gun upgrade). This feels annoying at best since you have unlimited ammo and it's not always shooting, but you have no control over it. Even better is in-race bonuses (repair, money, ammo) are in boxes that must be shot... so you have to hope an opponent is in front of you near a box so you could happen to shoot that (and they not just take your bonus) or you waste some of your limited ammo.  This is a small gripe, but the in level bonuses do need to be shot and all appear at the beginning of the level. Since shooting can be wasteful and feel a bit random, this means that upgrades you need later are hard to get and running into repairs within seconds of the race starting is common. It just feels like a bad decision. The original randomly spawned them on the track, IIRC, and that was fine. This isn't a realistic game; why must we pretend periodically that it is?  Opponents suffer from what a lot of games have with enemies that don't have the same limitations as you. I've mentioned their cars are always fast enough to rival yours no matter what. They also have unlimited ammo in their nicer weapons compared to the 4 shots you get in some of your weapons. This is especially terrible in the deathmatch sections where destroying cars is the goal yet they don't have to worry about ammo limits. Additionally, they have health like you do. When you hit 0%, you explode and are done. When they hit 0%, their health bar flashes... and they continue to race for a while. Some number of shots into them later (or maybe it's time? I couldn't definitively understand the logic but it seemed inconsistant and like I wasted a lot of ammo trying to kill a single target), they will in fact explode. You have no real indicator of when this is going to happen though, so I frequently found myself passing them and hoping to get their drop on the next lap if they happened to blow up. Though they can still shoot you in this state.  Speaking about laps, one of the biggest places this feels like a mobile game is in the race length. I'm not saying I need long races, but I do feel like the fact that most races take &lt;=1 minute to complete takes away from my enjoyment. That could just be a preference, though.  All this is not to say there is no fun to be had. I was entertained for a while. I could see this being more reasonable on a device without a gamepad or keyboard (I never did get my 360 controller to work with this game) like a tablet or phone where simple games are more acceptable. I at least wanted more. I wanted to feel like I had consequences or choices. I wanted to feel like my ability mattered. Instead, I was watching a nice looking (not amazing by any means, but it does look nice enough... if you don't look too closely at the textures) but repetative and short car chase scene from various movies. Things happen, but the ending never seemed to be directly related.

The cars ♥♥♥♥ing get destroyed dare you ram them in a 30+ degree angle at anything over 75 kmh, if you manage to survive, they will usually be veering to one side, without being any sort of turnable to the other anymore.

"This game is fun for 3 days, then you realize you've already done everything there is to do, been to the farthest left you can go and the farthest right. After you do that, shortly you'll collect all the gadgets have the highest tier set of armor and the realize 'wow, there is nothing more to do...'    No replay value whatsoever. Combat is awful when comparative to any other sandbox game like this. You'll lose every drive you had to play this game after a time peroid literally less than 3 days. This game is not hard to play, it's not fun afterwards, and you will be amazed at how quick you lose all interest in this game once you get the highest tier of armor on your first character. Unless you think you have fun doing the same thing over and over again, it's not worth it. Don't waste your time on this game, you will be so dissapointed in the end.   To add to Terraria's vast sea of negative features the multiplayer in this game is also pitiful. It takes ages to load worlds and maps, and half the time it crashes. It's only connection VIA IP, no servers. (though not a big deal on that one) and once you do get in a server connection issues are evident and just as unavoidable as smashing waves in high tide. And these waves will leave your sandcastle in ruin. Don't think you'll be able to easily play with your friends, because you won't. Connection issues will stop you. Game is easy to play through solo but rather hard to connect with friends and stay in a server long enough to have fun. If you are buying this game to play with your friends, simply buy another game. Wasting your time on Terraria's pathetic multiplayer will prove to be fruitless.  Want a simmilar game that you can get a lot more hours out of with better gameplay, combat, even storyline... and loads of customization along with randomized PLANETS instead of just randomized BIOMES... space travel, and 4 different races?

"Before I begin, I would like to point out that I can run Far Cry 3 on high graphics.   This game could be great. It already would be great, if not for one killer - fps. On low everything, this game lags like hell, and my gun appears to be hovering in my hands, which often go through it. Also, there are no tutorials. I know you can probably find them online somewhere, but it would be nice if there was an optional one you could participate in if you needed to. I really tried to enjoy this game, but the fps, which was probably about 7, ruined my experience.   When they fix the fps problems and major lag, then, and only then, will this be a reccomendation.

"A very boring rpg. Unless you have many free hours to kill, I recommend you stay away from this game. I was able to get 9 hours in before I made the decision to drop it for better games. Everything about the game was just too boring. The combat was super easy, the class system was average and the quests and story just didn’t have the right hook to get me interested.  The combat seems fun at first but then you quickly realize just how easy and frustrating it is. Enemies are generally dumb or cheesy. You can either face roll enemies or have no ability to dodge correctly, thanks to the wonderful camera and dodge system. You can try to dodge out of the way of an attack but occasionally the camera will be in such a spot that you instead dodge head first into the enemy, taking the damage and then some that you were trying to avoid. This happens more than enough to be frustrating. The quests and story is what truly killed this game for me. The beginning of the story is very bland and almost feels unoriginal. You come back to life after being dropped onto hundreds of decaying corpses to find out now that you have come back, you now have no fate and can change destinies. It seems like a cool concept but it’s surrounded by so many mediocre and cliché rpg elements that it drowns itself. I looked up the ending to the game to see if it redeems itself but let me tell you no, it does not. The story might have been more exciting if it wasn’t consumed by the hundreds of similar rpg quest tropes. Most of the quests turn into looking for a monster to kill, finding a missing person, and picking up items off the map or enemies.   I really wanted to like this game, I was excited for it when it came out but I held off on it hearing that it was just boring repetitive gameplay. Now that I was able to get it off Steam for cheap I have to say, they were right. Don’t bother playing this game. If you really have to though wait for a sale and make sure you have 20+ hours to dedicate to it.",-1,boring rpg unless many free hours kill recommend stay away game able get hours made decision drop better games everything game boring combat super easy class system average quests story didnt right hook get interested combat seems fun first quickly realize easy frustrating enemies generally dumb cheesy either face roll enemies ability dodge correctly thanks wonderful camera dodge system try dodge way attack occasionally camera spot instead dodge head first enemy taking damage trying avoid happens enough frustrating quests story truly killed game beginning story bland almost feels unoriginal come back life dropped onto hundreds decaying corpses find come back fate change destinies seems like cool concept surrounded many mediocre clich rpg elements drowns looked ending game see redeems let tell story might exciting wasnt consumed hundreds similar rpg quest tropes quests turn looking monster kill finding missing person picking items map enemies really wanted like game excited came held hearing boring repetitive gameplay able get steam cheap say right dont bother playing game really though wait sale make sure hours dedicate,"spit it out.

"As a start,sure it is an interesting game.After a few days it gets repetitive.From missions to customizations and so on. The game itself has a great base.Criminals against the Police,a great idea.Were the game starts to break down it is in it's execution,and the outside.In the trailers you can see that it's possible to make artwork with the creation tools.Well,yes you can,but you will soon see that it's limited,only an amount of geometric shapes you can use,same to the cars,clothes etc. One of the things that killed me is that everything was limited.I put a lot of money in this because I had hope. The matches are stupidly done.I couldn't play because it wasn't fair.They put 2 dudes with rank over 20,against 2 with over 10. The only thing that counts as 'fair' is how many people vs how many people.I couldn't level up,only if I was very good at it,and I wasn't.It's the same thing,even if you are a cop or a criminal.Criminal:Go and rob something,steal a car,go to a point,capture a point,protect a point or just transport an object without the cops seeing you.Cop:Go and stop the criminals from doing all that. There is no easy way of making money since the matches are soooo unfair.Only one way and it's only for criminal(sorry cops). It's basically destroying with your car shops windows.It's a boring way,but it's worth it.The shops will drop a few objects that you have to pick up and put in a car.Then go to an AI and give the stuff,after that go to another place to get the money for it.This way I made about 20-30k a day,but again it was getting boring. I found that one thing was funny,was playing with your friends,it has a massive multiplayer.So I was actually having fun,even if I was dead or alive. The game itself has a hidden wall in front of it.It doesn't let you pass that much,most of the cool things are either for premium or they are hard to get,and only if you are good.I am not saying that you cannot get good items without paying or premium,if you are good,you can get cool items.But it's really hard to get good.When I say good I mean 'super good'. The game also has clans,I had one but it was pretty dumb and lame.You can make a icon for the clan and spray it on special spots in the city.And it is true that you can actually make songs.I found myself creating a lot of music,so that will be fun. This game has a short amount of 'gamemodes'.There are two cities,they are basically the whole game.Then there's these 2 place from both cities,where there is like a 'free for all' gamemode,and the famous 'Hanging Plaza'.Where you create,buy,and sell. In a nutshell this game needs a lot of improvement.It is fun,but you will find it anoying after a while.So it does not worth your time.You can try playing it a few hours,but that's all.You will get bored.I must say that the game is full of glitches and bugs so watch out for that,some are funny,but some aren't.Even after many laughs it will started sucking your soul and just turn into a pain in the leg.Don't bother with putting any money in it.Play for a while and if you aren't 'super good' at it,just delete the game,it will get repetitive and you will get nervous because you can't killed anybody(because all over 20).If you aren't good at beating people that have over your rank,just leave it. In the end this game is something that should'va been developed by someone else.Someone who actually knows how to make a multiplayer game.If you haven't played the game,just try it and the play something else.I played it too much,I was frustrated that I wasn't killing anybody.Warning!YOU WILL NEED A GOOD COMPUTER! If you are reading my review,just don't touch it.It doesn't worth your time,go and play GTA or Saints Row instead of this thing. So this game gets the rating of 3/10,an epic fail.The idea is good,they screwed it up.Now it's just a stupid,frustrating game that gets a lot of bad reviews.After a spoiler that it will be gta 5,and a few changes of title,all developted by someone who doesn't know how to make games like this.This is what you get,you get 'A.P.B.:Reloaded'. And if you say 'Changes of title?'.Yes,the game was once called 'All Points Bulletin''(A.P.B.).There was no 'Reloaded'.Go google and get more indepth informations about the past game.I don't know that much about it.
