"Counter Strike is a classic game. Fun, addictive, and customizable. It's incredibly easy to mod, texture and map for so you could expect a whole lotta mods.  Pros: -Great gameplay, bit of a learning curve but it'll become second instinct soon enough -Servers are still up, even for such an old game it still has a whole crap-ton of servers.  -Modding community is GREAT -Cheap, as in really freakin cheap, not indie game cheap, but still very cheap Cons -Most people who you will play with have been playing for longer than I have been alive. Expect to get pwned very very often -Netcode is a ♥♥♥♥♥, adjusting settings using the console takes a hell of a while -People are sometimes way too serious when playing -For Graphics junkies: Graphics are pretty damn old-looking (what the hell do you expect it's GoldSrc)  While it's not a perfect game it still provided me with tons of fun and I love playing it. It's a bit slower than CSGO and the weapons behave differently.   Conclusion: If you want a nice classic shooter that's light on the pocket and the computer then this along with Half-Life should be in your library",1,counter strike classic game fun addictive customizable incredibly easy mod texture map could expect whole lotta mods pros great gameplay bit learning curve itll become second instinct soon enough servers still even old game still whole crapton servers modding community great cheap really freakin cheap indie game cheap still cheap cons people play playing longer alive expect get pwned often netcode adjusting settings using console takes hell people sometimes way serious playing graphics junkies graphics pretty damn oldlooking hell expect goldsrc perfect game still provided tons fun love playing bit slower csgo weapons behave differently conclusion want nice classic shooter thats light pocket computer along halflife library

"This game is dated, yes, but holy hell. The campaign is amazing! The many things that happen always keeping you on your feet and the many things you have to do as well! The characters are loveable in some way, whether it's how evil, how good, or just how funny. ZOMBIES! A REALLY good new gamemode! As much as I love the newer CoD's and their Zombies, I love WaW the most. It's scary at times, keeps you on your feet, makes you plan strategically, and all together, a VERY fun gamemode. The fun in zombies is only TRIPLED by the many maps you can get from the community! It's surprising they haven't allowed this for the other CoD games that have zombies, it'd be a blast! Plus, there are some great ideas out there that really work! The multiplayer, however, is.....another story. There's hackers everywhere, barely anyone plays it anymore, modders around every corner- BASICALLY! Stay away from Multiplayer. Omitting the Multiplayer, this game is very good and I would recommend it to anyone. 8/10 Would play for years",1,game dated yes holy hell campaign amazing many things happen always keeping feet many things well characters loveable way whether evil good funny zombies really good new gamemode much love newer cods zombies love waw scary times keeps feet makes plan strategically together fun gamemode fun zombies tripled many maps get community surprising havent allowed cod games zombies itd blast plus great ideas really work multiplayer however isanother story theres hackers everywhere barely anyone plays anymore modders around every corner basically stay away multiplayer omitting multiplayer game good would recommend anyone would play years

"Counter-Strike, this one also known as Counter-Strike 1.6, is a team-based multiplayer realistical/military shooter. And a very well known one at that. It was first available as a free mod for Half-Life 1, being patched regulary up to version 1.6, until recently it got it's way onto Steam, as a serapately sold title.  So, how is the player base? Counter-strike 1.6, being popular self, has an active player base. You will see many servers, up to 32 players. At very least there are many Russian servers, as it had a cult following over there, can't really see past them. On bad side, most seems to prefer 'Terrorist plant C4' mode and then De_Dust2 is the most played map. A lot of servers run small mods, that may alter balance or other small things. And most of it, playerbase had a lot of time to play and master this game, so new players will be more frustated than having fun learning.  Counter-Strike is a very well known realistical FPS. It gained it's popularity while being free mod for popular Half-Life, because it provided something else what wasn't overused yet - realistical shootouts (using models of real weapons, you know) in team multiplayer. Unforgiving and furious. Or unbalanced and twitchy one-shot kills with headshots. Whichever one you prefer.   Counter-Strike has two types of map. First, 'de', is a mode where counter-terrorists have do defends few market spots on map from terrorist. One of the terrorists spawns with C4 in inventrory and has to bring it to one of the marked spots to plant it adn start to countdown of T's victory. Roles change as Terrorists will have now to defend this place from CTs, who's aim now are to defuse the bomb, in which case CTs will win the round, no matter how many more Ts are left. Pretty interesting mode and most played, otherwise this game would have been camping fest. And if one site is too well defended, Ts can go to another one. And then there is a second type, 'cs', in which CTs have to to rescue hostages by bringing them back to base. The problem there, is that hostage NPCs aren't perfect (though good enough) and since CTs have to rescue them all, Terrorist can camp in one of the spots around them, since CTs will have no choice but to come to win. Much less played and even if it does, it goes like your everyday Team Deathmatch, just killing all of opposite team. Much simpler anyway.  Now, the core gameplay... There are few rounds. Each round starts with each team spawning on their side of map. There is no respawning during round, once person is dead he is out, so you will have to worry much more about getting insta-killed. There are no items placed on map itself either (on correct, official maps), no kind of medikits. In spawn place, you have 15 seconds to press 'b' button (or whichever you set) to bring up 'buy menu', where you purchase weapons and equipment for the round witht he money that you earned so far. Yep, when round ends everybody gets some sum of money to spend, with winning team getting more, an ingenius design decision that helps losing team to get steamrolled even harder. What you can buy there is a pistol, primary weapon and any of the equipment. (Yep, if it doesn't smell like prototype of modern military shooters) Once past purchase screen, you are free to run and shoot. And here comes the art of recoil and aiming. For you see, one of the more important thing that is used in this game is accuaricy of your weapon. If you move it drops. if you jump, it drops. It drops while you are shooting too. Thus it becomes more importanly to get good position, making assaults more compilated, and you often have to relearn to shoot, making few clicks instead of just holding down mouse button. You will have to be often walking instead of running, to keep accuaricy while moving (it also makes you silent, so do it often), or just stand and crouch sometimes. Burst shooting is better there and for long range targets you want to be just click few times. Another important thing is that you can shoot through some walls with more powerful primary weapons. So don't be surprised for people shooting through door, walls and even just over the corner, it indeed does small damage to whoever is behind. The game also emphasises aiming because it supports headshots and they do a MASSIVE damage. And you also got three kinds of grenades. Explosive (HE), which explodes, good for throwing into chokepoints. Flashbang, which blinds whoever looked at it when it blows for few seconds, quite annoying but good for stroming into room. And Smoke Grenade, when you don't want enemies to see you coming and don't want to be under direct fire, good for open spaces with snipers (who instakill you when you peek around corner). Protip: You run slightly faster with knife out.  And well, while on theory it sounds interesting, as well as empashises teamwork. here comes the downfall of the game. The weapons, while make people with gun fetish happy, are badly balanced around each other. There are just best and bad weapons. From pistols Desert Eagle is the best, they behave as backup when you got no time to reload primary weapon. Shotguns are theorically good for close range but in this game they are useless and Assault Rifles can kill even better at close range. Sub-Machine Guns category had advantage of no accuaricy drops while moving, but are still inferior to Rifles. Rifles category has two best guns: all-range assault rifle like AK-47 and all-range sniper rifle like AWP (which doesn't even require headshot to one-hit kill), exactly what majority of people use. The only Machine Gun is 'pew pew pew can't hit'. And all-range is all-range, random is random. You may run and shoot in general direction of enemy and pull off a headshot from your AK-47 by luck. Or you may walk around corner, thinking of your next grandious tactical plan, just to get headshotted in insta-second by guy with sniper rifle from close range. It's just so full of cheap and frustating, the rage is probably the main thing that keeps players coming back for more, not honest fun, as well as luck of possibly pulling few magical headshots. Slow-down when being hit doesn't seem to be good idea either, making it harder to get away from the choke points. And random spread is not actually random, it just randomly follows one of the pre-set pattern. And yes, if you will learn them, you will be able to control your shooting better and get on top. Exactly what puts apart newbiews and elites, and exactly what elites seem to boast about when they want to say that Counter-Strike 1.6 is the best because it takes more skills and time to learn, with artifical challenges like this one that makes little sense. And well, once you spend your time to learn them, you will still find out on top that it didn't make the game any more amazing.  But you know, it's not too bad. It does teamwork well. Sometimes the game just works. When you work along the team, round the corners and storming the next room, where you follow teammates, supporting each other. Provide covering fire to the corner. When upon entering next place, each one covers his own direction, as some of the rooms just have too many places from which enemies can shoot you (smoke grenade and flashbangs help in these cases). And it's pretty damn nice at those moments, until they get ruined by something stupid, something you don't feel like could be prevented. Yea, getting shot by sniper.  And yes, this game has good enough sounds. No music, sadly. The graphics are quite HL1 high-definition era, but otherwise are fine enough. The levels are a bit of bland though.  Can't really recommend it. Because everybody who will like such games are already playing it. And player base of this game had too much time by now, that they will be just way too skilled for new players, who will just get destroyed and it will take a long time to get onto same level. It's not like there aren't enough military/realistical shooters anyway.",-1,counterstrike one also known counterstrike teambased multiplayer realisticalmilitary shooter well known one first available

The player base is still pretty good after all these years and there are hundreds of maps available to download for free. A big shout out to all the map makers out there still making maps, you are what keeps this game going strong. I can't think of much more to say than this, If you enjoy killing zombies and experiencing WW2 Then this game is you for you. I highly recommend buying this game.",1,still good came call duty world war far favorite call duty game especially nazi zombies game revolutionized way play zombies provided unthinkable amount hours gameplay modded maps really keep game alive interesting player base still pretty good years hundreds maps available download free big shout map makers still making maps keeps game going strong cant think much say enjoy killing zombies experiencing ww game highly recommend buying game

"In a nutshell: 10/10 - Really good game for being what it is, an old classic.  What is Counter-Strike? - This is basically SWAT team simulator 2000, it's a pretty competitive 5v5 FPS shooter where you must stop the terrorists from a range of objectives, such as rescuing hostages, defusing bombs or killing terrorists before they plant their bomb, even escort missions where you must escort a buddy to a helicopter! As terrorists your goal is to well, kill the Counter-Terrorists, to put it bluntly.  Will it Run on my Computer? - Considering my cheap Lenovo G580 with integrated graphics can handle this at 60fps, unless you use a really outdated PC (like, a computer made before 3D games were commonplace) I'm sure your fine.  Parent's Guide - I'd say FPS games are generally a no-no for parents who care about what their children play, and actually, this game, if you go into settings and turn blood off, its actually not too bad, I'd say 13+ is appropriate.  Graphics - (Note: This game was released in 2000, excuse what is terrible graphics nowadays), pretty good graphics, all the characters are in pretty good detail and the guns look nice and pretty realistic-looking.   Gameplay - I will say, it's quite fun, but I will tell you, this is a game meant to be played with friends or meant to be played with players who are good at teamwork, your entire team could lose simply from one player on your team not going with your team's plans.  Is it Worth The Price? - Yes, absolutely, if you want to see where CS:GO started, get it for sure!",1,nutshell really good game old classic counterstrike basically swat team simulator pretty competitive v fps shooter must stop terrorists range objectives rescuing hostages defusing bombs killing terrorists plant bomb even escort missions must escort buddy helicopter terrorists goal well kill counterterrorists put bluntly run computer considering cheap lenovo g integrated graphics handle fps unless use really outdated pc like computer made games commonplace im sure fine parents guide id say fps games generally nono parents care children play actually game go settings turn blood actually bad id say appropriate graphics note game released excuse terrible graphics nowadays pretty good graphics characters pretty good detail guns look nice pretty realisticlooking gameplay say quite fun tell game meant played friends meant played players good teamwork entire team could lose simply one player team going teams plans worth price yes absolutely want see csgo started get sure

"What to say about World at War? Well, the fact that the multiplayer is practically dead, the only thing you can do is play the single-player, and spec-ops.  Now, you may be asking, 'Why is the multiplayer dead?' The reason why it's dead, is because of the amount of hickers and children. Hickers in this game are the worst, even if you report a hicker, another five are going to take that persons place.   The game is NOT secure. I recommend you buy Modern Warfare 1, or any of the new COD titles. Such as Modern Warfare 2, Black Ops, and Black Ops 2, but NOT Ghosts. Ghosts is a terrible PC port, and is not worth it, but that is for another review. Modern Warfare 1 is the most secured, due to its dedicated servers, which keeps it alive, and 'clean' of hickers and cheaters.  Some examples of hickers in World at War, are people who use:  Wallhickers Aimbots Instant Level Ten Prestige, and ALL Unlocks Hud-Hicking (Yes, it does exist) Instant VAC Ban  The Instant VAC Ban is the WORST thing that can happen to you. I really do advise you to make private games, and play them with your friends, or find trustworthy people on Steam who host games in WaW that are safe.  Please, please, please watch what servers/hosted matches you join. I really don't want innocent players to get banned.  I've heard that Search and Destroy games are safe, but the player count is very little in most game types.  If you are still going to buy this game, and play the multiplayer, contact me. I will try my best to help find SAFE games for you, but the chances of finding these are very small. I wish all of you people luck.  Overall, get it for the spec-ops, and the singleplayer.  Edit: I no longer play WaW. The main reason why, is because I had a VERY close encounter with a hicked lobby. I'm no longer willing to risk my account.  Stay safe, and play safe...and watch for hickers...  -Cheers   old cod better   0/10 (can I get it any lower??)",-1,say world war well fact multiplayer practically dead thing play singleplayer specops may asking multiplayer dead reason dead amount hickers children hickers game worst even report hicker another five going take persons place game secure recommend buy modern warfare new cod titles modern warfare black ops black ops ghosts ghosts terrible pc port worth another review modern warfare secured due dedicated servers keeps alive clean hickers cheaters examples hickers world war people use wallhickers aimbots instant level ten prestige unlocks hudhicking yes exist instant vac ban instant vac ban worst thing happen really advise make private games play friends find trustworthy people steam host games waw safe please please please watch servershosted matches join really dont want innocent players get banned ive heard search destroy games safe player count little game types still going buy game play multiplayer contact try best help find safe games chances finding small wish people luck overall get specops singleplayer edit longer play waw main reason close encounter hicked lobby im longer willing risk account stay safe play safeand watch hickers cheers old cod better get lower

PROS: - Original Nazi Zombies (main reason I originally bought it) - Great campaign - Really, really fun (and sometimes challenging!) multiplayer - Great maps  The only problem is that multiplayer sometimes does not function correctly because the multiplayer service, PunkBuster, is outdated and no longer functions. This becomes a huge problem because you cannot play multiplayer without it, so in order to get it to work, you'd have to jump through some hoops.

Call of Duty World at War is thee first CoD game I have finished since MW3 and that was what finished my Call of Duty gaiming. However I have recently come back to the series before the franchise decided to send WW2 games on its way and not to get hit by the door on the way out. So I bought the Warchest on sale for £17. So I recently completed WaW and heres my review.  WaW is one of those games I'm am very on the fence about. Becuase it has those moments when you can predict whats going to happen next. Although someparts of this game where fun some of it felt tedias and frustrating. I loved the Russian missions later on in the campaign although a mission that really anoyed me was a mission where you played as a tank. In said mission you are the only tank on your convoy who is smart enough not to just stay in one spot just waiting to get hit by FLAK 88 shot. So you have to kill everything in this certain area.  I enjoyed the Japanese missions although some of them where full of Banzi chargers. The missions get very interesting and fun later on when you fell patriotic even though your not from the same country. In a later Russian mission I decided to war headphones and look closly to the screen and I ended up shouting 'Charge' whilst everyone in the game was also shouting.  I definatly enjoyed this game and I will probably give it a 8/10 10 being my favourite game and 1 being Ride to Hell Retribution. So again this is a game that if you like the theatres it is set in then definatly pick it up. But probably wait until you find a good deal/price.   p.s. I didn't play zombies becuase I didn't wan't to play it-I feel it would be better with a friend.  pp.s. I didn't play multiplayer becuase I have made the assumption that it died of years ago as there is no games.,1,call duty world war thee first cod game finished since mw finished call duty gaiming however recently come back series franchise decided send ww games way get hit door way bought warchest sale recently completed waw heres review waw one games im fence becuase moments predict whats going happen next although someparts game fun felt tedias frustrating loved russian missions later campaign although mission really anoyed mission played tank said mission tank convoy smart enough stay one spot waiting get hit flak shot kill everything certain area enjoyed japanese missions although full banzi chargers missions get interesting fun later fell patriotic even though country later russian mission decided war headphones look closly screen ended shouting charge whilst everyone game also shouting definatly enjoyed game probably give favourite game ride hell retribution game like theatres set definatly pick probably wait find good dealprice ps didnt play zombies becuase didnt want play iti feel would better friend pps didnt play multiplayer becuase made assumption died years ago games

"I'm reviewing solely the campaign portion of World at War, since that's what I got the game for and all that I've played.  Years after enjoying World War II shooters like Medal of Honor: Frontline and Call of Duty 2: Big Red One, I wanted something of the same mold. After asking people and reading reviews, I believed that World at War would have the best campaign yet.  I would be disappointed.   From beginning to end, World at War lacks intensity, persuasiveness, and engagement. The game places you onto tracks upon which you complete missions by going through a series of checkpoints. The campaign rushes through the war to put most of its focus on the last months before the Third Reich surrendered, so the momentum’s on your side from the start and nothing you and your squad do actually matters. You play a Russian and American soldier alternatively, who both get undue amounts of recognition by their squad leaders while remaining privates throughout their careers. Insufficient effort is made to make either character feel like your own; instead, you’re seeing their experiences in first person. Treyarch apparently intended to portray common soldiers as unrecognized heroes, and the game developer did an admirable job at that. But besides engendering respect, nearly every other aspect of the game falls short of what even predecessors had.  Whereas in Frontline, many of your missions were done alone and getting to work with teammates was a treat, here, you are always fighting with comrades. There is no infiltrating a village or mansion alone, or completing a mission by modulating your pace and playing style. Instead, you go down hallways and courtyards with your squad, occasionally getting to choose whether to take the right, left, or center path to kill the enemies your allies may take out anyway if you let them. Unlike Big Red One, formerly intimidating trenches are just places to rush in and out as you proceed to your next objective, which will be no more interesting to complete than the last one.  During each mission, I hoped that the game would finally become fun, but by the time around ten hours had elapsed, the campaign was complete with few instances worth remembering, and those few were times when I’d all but ignored my squad to assault the enemies alone for brief action-packed moments before getting killed.  One the whole, the World at War formula’s something like this: Wait to get ambushed. Pick up that weapon. Kill those guys (if you can, before your too-ballsy-to-live squadmates rush out and get themselves killed, not that it matters). Move to the next point. Rinse and repeat. If World at War’s placed in a nutshell, it won’t want for room.",-1,im reviewing solely campaign portion world war since thats got game ive played years enjoying world war ii shooters like medal honor frontline call duty big red one wanted something mold asking people reading reviews believed world war would best campaign yet would disappointed beginning end world war lacks intensity persuasiveness engagement game places onto tracks upon complete missions going series checkpoints campaign rushes war put focus last months third reich surrendered momentums side start nothing squad actually matters play russian american soldier alternatively get undue amounts recognition squad leaders remaining privates throughout careers insufficient effort made make either character feel like instead youre seeing experiences first person treyarch apparently intended portray common soldiers unrecognized heroes game developer admirable job besides engendering respect nearly every aspect game falls short even predecessors whereas frontline many missions done alone getting work teammates treat always fighting comrades infiltrating village mansion alone completing mission modulating pace playing style instead go hallways courtyards squad occasionally getting choose whether take right left center path kill enemies allies may take anyway let unlike big red one formerly intimidating trenches places rush proceed next objective interesting complete last one mission hoped game would finally become fun time around ten hours elapsed campaign complete instances worth remembering times id ignored squad assault enemies alone brief actionpacked moments getting killed one whole world war formulas something like wait get ambushed pick weapon kill guys tooballsytolive squadmates rush get killed matters move next point rinse repeat world wars placed nutshell wont want room

I would recommend this but actvision seem to think that £1 = $1 so i recommend 1 of these 4 ways.   1. Waiting for it to go on sale on a website like  amazon.com  or any other website that doesn't use pounds this one would be the safest but you would be having to wait (or buy it off sale would still be cheaper).  2. Use a VPN this would be the more difficult one out of the 4 due to them being slow and finding one that you can use.  3. Get someone to buy if for you this is the way i did it but i would recommend getting a friend that you can trust to do it because get a some you don't know to do it they could easily take the money and run.  4. Buying it with TF2 keys this is be the best one out of the 4 IMO because people on trading websites like tf2outpost put trades up for it that use the price of it when its on sale (this only when the game is on sale)you also can buy TF2 keys for cheap from the community market its just finding some on outpost that is selling it for the sale price because of the websites crappy auto bump feature.  Its a shame because this is a very good game but i just cant recommend something that thinks that $1 = £1,-1,would recommend actvision seem think recommend ways waiting go sale website like amazoncom website doesnt use pounds one would safest would wait buy sale would still cheaper use vpn would difficult one due slow finding one use get someone buy way would recommend getting friend trust get dont know could easily take money run buying tf keys best one imo people trading websites like tfoutpost put trades use price sale game saleyou also buy tf keys cheap community market finding outpost selling sale price websites crappy auto bump feature shame good game cant recommend something thinks

"Wow.  This is a game I grew up with and it's one of the most popular online first-person-shooters out there, or atleast; it used to be. The game was everywhere, and it had its reasons to. This was the game that was seen on the computer screens of the LAN parties, tournaments and other major computer related events.  It's action-packed, skill-based and it had a huge following. Even today you may find lots of server filled with players. The gameplay surrounds around you and your team. If you play the 'DE maps' you're a terrorist, you must plant the bomb and make sure that the CT's won't defuse it and if you're in the CT team, you must defuse the bomb before it goes off. If you play the 'CS maps' you must rescue the hostages as a CT and if you're on the terrorist team you must keep the hostages held-up and eliminate any CT that tries to stop you.

"This installment of the Call of Duty series has an immersive and fun single player campaign that's almost as good as the one in the first Modern Warfare game. You'll be walking through tall grass and suddenly you're surrounded by Japanese soldiers camouflaged with leaves, enemy soldiers will sneak up behind you from the bushes and try to put a blade to your throat, enemies will shoot dirt over your vision, etc. You'll get disoriented, overwhelmed, pinned, you'll be in war. It's an accurate depiction of WWII and makes you feel like you're really being attacked and fighting for your life. It's quite an experience and I think they did a great job with it. Straying from the single player campaign, there are Nazi zombie levels, which are pretty fun. Here you're placed in the middle of a zombie invasion standing your ground and defending your fort of sorts. When zombies break in, you have to repair the borders and such that they destroyed to get in (like boarding up windows to keep them at bay). You can upgrade your weapons throughout each round with the in-game money you gain with each kill. It adds replayability where you can see how many rounds you can survive. I recommend this game on a sale for it's amazing single player experience.",1,installment call duty series immersive fun single player campaign thats almost good one first modern warfare game youll walking tall grass suddenly youre surrounded japanese soldiers camouflaged leaves enemy soldiers sneak behind bushes try put blade throat enemies shoot dirt vision etc youll get disoriented overwhelmed pinned youll war accurate depiction wwii makes feel like youre really attacked fighting life quite experience think great job straying single player campaign nazi zombie levels pretty fun youre placed middle zombie invasion standing ground defending fort sorts zombies break repair borders destroyed get like boarding windows keep bay upgrade weapons throughout round ingame money gain kill adds replayability see many rounds survive recommend game sale amazing single player experience

"The game is actually good, just not for the price.  I picked this up for three dollars, it came with another game and it was at Dollarama in a physical case. I figured multiplayer on Steam was a thing, since I originally bought a copy for my friend from the same Dollarama and noticed it had steam.  I'm a bit disappointed that it still doesn't exist, same with a lot of features that you'd expect. However, it seems to be ready for multiplayer to be added, as well as the ability to support never-incoming workshop content, since the mods are all really simple reskins.  The game is very simple and fun, and the story is mature, B-movie level garbage, as if Kung Pow: Enter the Fist was directed by Cheech and Chong.   If anyone can find Mr. Healey and get him to mend in workshop and multiplayer or pass the license off to someone willing and capable, it might do a whole hell of a lot better, rather than abandoning it for the PSN version, or even the iTunes comedy doodle version.

I would highly recommend this game if you love Call of Duty Zombies because there are so many custom maps for you to play and they are simple to install. The campaign is great and is extremely challenging on Veteran difficulty mainly because of the grenade spam.

"World at War is a masterpiece and a damn good game. The gameplay is simply COD4 with a different era.   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=359464240  Its fun, fast, and arcadie. In terms of singleplayer, this installment saw you brave the horrors of WWII from both a Russian and American perspective; battling the Japanesse on Iwo Jima   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=358229015  and beating down the 3rd Reich from Stalingrad to Berlin. Featuring the voice talents of Keifer Sutherland for the American Sgt. Roebuck, and Gary Oldman for the premier of the legendary hard-as-nails Russian sniper - Viktor Reznov. The campaign is both compelling and fantasicaly written with mixes of close and ranged combat along a spectrum of locales beautifully designed and planned. The singleplayer is, as far as im concerned, unsurpassable by any other 'Call of Duty' game.   Multiplayer is still alive and active. The servers are very fun to play in and have a lot of active players on them. WaW's multiplayer is very fun and solid. It may have a couple of cheap moments like any other COD has. But it is still very enjoyable and can keep you entertained for a couple of hours.  As always I leave the best for last. Zombies! Call of Duty: World at War's zombie mode is one of the best co-op experiences I have ever had. Its fun, gameplay is solid, theres a story, and it will give you and your friends hours upon hours of entertainment. The game comes with 4 solid maps to play on. Natch Der Untoten, Verruckt, Shi No Numa, and Der Riese. These maps offer great variety and are very fun to play in. Zombies is the biggest and most alive part of this game. With a community that has created thousands upon thousands of custom zombie maps that one can enjoy. Many map makers like ZCT and TMG provide high quality maps that can be compared to Treyarch's best.   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=359152137  You still reading eh? Go and buy this game NOW! Yeah thats right, NOW!

"-Love to shoot people with real life guns with different names? -Have you ever dreamed to kill terrorists and even be a terrorist? -Love playing the same, universal map over and over just because it's the only map you'll ever know? (*cough* dust2) -Have you a desire to work as a team to complete objectives? -Do you know how to speak Brazilian-Portuguese and Romanian? (Awesome because many servers have players that have Brazilians, Romanians, and many other South American/Eurpoean players) -Love nostalgia? -Love to have fun? -Love getting an extra game with bots in it for free?  -Love randomly dying from wallbangs?  Great, you've come to the right game. Seriously though, despite the somewhat smaller North American community (Which is still big for the old game it is) it's probably one of the greatest games i've ever come to play, and i've only had it for about a year, and i'm gonna add hundreds of thousands of hours playing this. I don't even have actual friends that play with me yet I can still have fun with this game. From the countless recoil patterns to remember from all the guns, to the extremely friendly community (for the most part) and playing all these classic maps. Yes, of course there's hackers, you'll see a few of them, but they don't ruin the game. Either the server's admin can just ban them or you can just go to a different server, it's not gamebreaking or anything. And besides, if you get this you also get Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, which has bots. Hell, you can even download Zbots for 1.6, and it waypoints for you! Definitely get this game.

"Call of Duty World at War is a classic World War 2 First Person Shooter. Infact it is one of the better ones. In the Singleplayer Campaign you switch between two fronts: The Japanese-American and the Russian-German Front. Both Stories are alright, but the Russian one has way more Character Development than the American One. The Multiplayer is your Basic Call of Duty Multiplayer, but with (of course) WW2 Guns. The Multiplayer has small, but also some Bigger Maps. On some Big Maps you can even use Tanks to destroy your Enemies. After beating the Capmpaign you unlock the Zombie Mode 'Nazi Zombies', which is the best thing about this game. Fight the undead horde round by round as long as possible. Arms yourself up with guns and perks and slay em all &gt;:3. This game also supports mods. There are many mods for this game which add more zombie-Maps to play on.

"First starting off as a cute, little mod based on the GoldSrc engine, a heavily modified Quake engine, Counter-Strike's legacy continues to strife for a decade and a half over. Initially developed and released on top of a Half-Life modification, with the inspiration from the developer's strong theme and intriguement for military warfare and terrorism, the mod's success was immediately a marvel to behold; selling over 25 million units as a whole in the Counter-Strike franchise.  The maps and various scenarios set around the globe, players assume the roles of soldiers on two teams, counter-terrorists and terrorists. Both with a task, depending differently on the mission. Bomb scenarios, the terrorist team must plant a bomb, in a secured bomb location, while the counter-terrorists must fight back and ultimately defuse the bomb, if it may have been planted. Hostage scenarios is where the counter-terrorists must rescue a group of hostages being held by the terrorists. With both these modes, it has become a traditional campaign over time in different sequels.  The player, depending on what team they have been assigned to, can change their class into eight different character models, as well as buying weaponry and equipment, such as armour and grenades to help against the opposing team. As the round is about to begin, you're left in ''Freeze time'' that allows you to buy things with the money you earned by killing opponents the rounds before. This of course, gives players the time needed to choose wisely on what many strategies they will execute and whether it will be successful compared to your opponents.   This game is also highly customizable on the player's end.The game gives the options allowing for the user to either install or create their own custom skins, spray graphics, sprites, sound effects and HUDS that can be used in-game. I forgot to mention that modding is possibly one the biggest things that makes Counter-Strike such a versatile game to begin with.  I don't have much to complain about this game, other than it's become one of the biggest targets of hacking and cheaters, since its release. Aimbots, that auto-target other players while the player should naturally aim and shoot is just on of the many cheatings that players have executed. Wallhacks, that allows the player to see through walls through work by displaying objects that have translucent textures and can easily see targets through them, while the opposing team has no idea from their own perspective. To me, the cheating in this game is now more to do with experimenting than it is to do with cheating overall.   There's a different meaning when it comes to something that is outdated and old-school. Old-school is for nostalgic value, something that will guarantee to put a smile back on your face from all these past memories you've experienced and this is what the first title of Counter-Strike engulfs. Outdated, being something you don't particularly want to go back to, while there is the famous remake, Counter-Strike: Source, that runs on the more powerful and overly-recycled Source engine, allowing for better graphic and communication capabilities. Nevertheless, if you're looking for original flare that is burning in the Counter-Strike series, this game is definitely for you.  And to think, all of this success for the Counter-Strike series began as small little mod. Proof on how something so little, can create something so big.

If you came here for the singleplayer, its pretty good. Still the same thing that you probably played on consoles, and I didn't notice any extra bugs when I played through it. Though the lack of achievements made some of the easter eggs a bit harder to notice (Saving Pvt. Ryan). I didn't play coop campaign, but it is there, as well as death cards.   If multiplayer was what interested you, I can't particularly reccomend this to you. Its more alive (or atleast easier to get into a match for) than on the console, but its still fairly empty. Most of the servers I found lagged a bit for me, but when I did manage to find a good match, it was pretty fun.   Overall, it is a definite buy if you really like zombies but wouldn't mind a campaign or some multiplayer. If you have a lot of friends with this game who you can organize matches with, its hard not to reccomend buying it.",1,like nazi zombies literally nothing better hundreds high quality maps play tools available make fantastic came singleplayer pretty good still thing probably played consoles didnt notice extra bugs played though lack achievements made easter eggs bit harder notice saving pvt ryan didnt play coop campaign well death cards multiplayer interested cant particularly reccomend alive atleast easier get match console still fairly empty servers found lagged bit manage find good match pretty fun overall definite buy really like zombies wouldnt mind campaign multiplayer lot friends game organize matches hard reccomend buying

"This version of the game is basically buying a rippd or cracked version. First off the camplain is great and very fun and yes it does have its random bugs and glitches every once in a while just like any good game. Second the multiplayer is nothing like it use to be. Every map has either mods or hackers in it. Pretty much everyone only plays hardcore mode. And people will boost your prestige to max in some lobbies so it means you wont be able to have that fun experiance getting those levels up yourself. Third, There is NO multiplayer zombies. I repeat! NO multiplayer zombies unless you download some off steam program that allows you to technically illegally host a zombies match(steam allows this) and even at that, most of everyone has a closed nat type when you need a open nat type to play. Lastly, a lot of buttons wont even work, they either crash your game or just crash steam fully. And some buttons wont even take you to the right location of where it was suppose to go. SO! If you plan on buying this game for the multiplayer zombies! DON'T GET IT. Unless ofcourse you plan on playing by yourself then go right ahead.",-1,version game basically buying rippd cracked version first camplain great fun yes random bugs glitches every like good game second multiplayer nothing like use every map either mods hackers pretty much everyone plays hardcore mode people boost prestige max lobbies means wont able fun experiance getting levels third multiplayer zombies repeat multiplayer zombies unless download steam program allows technically illegally host zombies matchsteam allows even everyone closed nat type need open nat type play lastly lot buttons wont even work either crash game crash steam fully buttons wont even take right location suppose go plan buying game multiplayer zombies dont get unless ofcourse plan playing go right ahead

It may be a re-skin of CoD4 but that just means the Good War is back and it's better then ever.  Despite the grumblings of many, World at War shows there is still a lot of fight left in WWII as a setting. And despite some obvious shortcomings, like the broken audio and straightforward story, World at War is every bit as intense, polished and fun as it's predecessor. The presentation is top notch, with cutscenes that mix real wartime footage with sleek, modern graphics. The short singleplayer campaign is helped by a terrific multiplayer and co-op portion as well as the ever fun Nazi mode. World at War doesn't reinvent the wheel by staying snugly in Modern Warfare's shadow, but it does make for a thrilling and enjoyable ride that fans of WWII and shooters alike are sure to appreciate.",1,difficulty right bottom line plain fungreat score note game tried reviewed offline mode another steam account consoles may reskin cod means good war back better ever despite grumblings many world war shows still lot fight left wwii setting despite obvious shortcomings like broken audio straightforward story world war every bit intense polished fun predecessor presentation top notch cutscenes mix real wartime footage sleek modern graphics short singleplayer campaign helped terrific multiplayer coop portion well ever fun nazi mode world war doesnt reinvent wheel staying snugly modern warfares shadow make thrilling enjoyable ride fans wwii shooters alike sure appreciate

"Call Of Duty: World at War is the prime example of how good Call Of Duty used to be. Say what you will about the newer instalments of this franchise, but understand that Call Of Duty used to be something magical. From its excellent single-player to its limitlessly fun and addicting zombie mode, word at war holds up perfectly, with the exception of an all-around 'ok' multiplayer component, which has not aged well in my opinion. Not to mention the mod support, which is extremely easy to operate, and gives you access to an insane amount of custom maps for the zombie mode, which equals an insane amount of content.  -The single-player mode will see you playing from two different perspectives during the second world war, one from the eyes of an American soldier, taking part in the war against Japan, and the other from the eyes of a Red Army soldier, taking part in the eastern front against the nazi-occupied Germany. Both sides of the story are equally thrilling (the latter being the best in my opinion), with excellent performances from both Kiefer Sutherland (as Roebuck) and Gary Oldman (as Reznov). The graphics are great for the time and still hold up, the music is kickass, the gore is gruesome, the guns are really fun to use. and the main characters portrayed by Sutherland and Oldman are fantastic,  -The zombies mode will see you surviving an endless onslaught of undead nazis, as you gain points for killing and use them for weapons or perks to help you survive. There are four maps to chose from (or over 1000 if you chose to use mods) that vary in size and difficulty. You unlock more areas of the maps with the aforementioned points and are encouraged to use your points for powerful and unique weapons that can be found. The characters that you play as (more specifically in the latter of the maps) are charismatic, funny, and drop-dead hilarious some times. And on a more personal note, the zombies mode is the highlight of the game for me, with the majority of my play time spent on it.  -The multiplayer mode is, basic to say the least. Back in 2008 it might have been something special, but now it is as basic as it gets. Two teams of six gun eachother down in a variety of modes, which will see them ranking up, unlocking new weapons, attachments, perks and modifiers. The playerbase is baron and near empty, with only a handfull of servers still up and running, and a handfull of those being dedicated and hacker-free. It is still fun, dont get me wrong, but it's nothing special.  If I were to rate Call of Duty: World at War (this version in particular i.e. the steam version), I'd give it a solid 9/10. It is my favourite game of all time, and when I die, I wish to be buried with it (oh, and every day at 6 o' clock I bow to the west and worship treyarch, but thats not important I guess ;P)",1,call duty world war prime example good call duty used say newer instalments franchise understand call duty used something magical excellent singleplayer limitlessly fun addicting zombie mode word war holds perfectly exception allaround ok multiplayer component aged well opinion mention mod support extremely easy operate gives access insane amount custom maps zombie mode equals insane amount content singleplayer mode see playing two different perspectives second world war one eyes american soldier taking part war japan eyes red army soldier taking part eastern front nazioccupied germany sides story equally thrilling latter best opinion excellent performances kiefer sutherland roebuck gary oldman reznov graphics great time still hold music kickass gore gruesome guns really fun use main characters portrayed sutherland oldman fantastic zombies mode see surviving endless onslaught undead nazis gain points killing use weapons perks help survive four maps chose chose use mods vary size difficulty unlock areas maps aforementioned points encouraged use points powerful unique weapons found characters play specifically latter maps charismatic funny dropdead hilarious times personal note zombies mode highlight game majority play time spent multiplayer mode basic say least back might something special basic gets two teams six gun eachother variety modes see ranking unlocking new weapons attachments perks modifiers playerbase baron near empty handfull servers still running handfull dedicated hackerfree still fun dont get wrong nothing special rate call duty world war version particular ie steam version id give solid favourite game time die wish buried oh every day clock bow west worship treyarch thats important guess p

"Wow... Just Wow. This is probably one of my favorite call of dutys of all time!   The Campaign is AMAZING! It made me feel like I was in World War II, you have characters you actually care about (my personal favorite being Polonsky). and the story is AMAZING!  The Muiltiplayer: From my time playing the muiltiplayer the game isnt very populated. There are only 270 servers as I saw and it lies about the player count. If you play CoD for the muiltiplayer do not get this game. But it does have a great selection of weapons which is nice  Zerbambos/Zombies: The most fun and simplistic zombies yet! You have 4 maps and they are all really good. I love zombies on this game best zombies in any treyarch game!  Verdict: The game is mostly for people who want to play the campaign or zombies. The muiltiplayer is not very good, If the game had more players and more servers I would have given this game a 5/5 but for now I give this game a  4/5 Good but needs some work on the muiltiplayer",1,wow wow probably one favorite call dutys time campaign amazing made feel like world war ii characters actually care personal favorite polonsky story amazing muiltiplayer time playing muiltiplayer game isnt populated servers saw lies player count play cod muiltiplayer get game great selection weapons nice zerbamboszombies fun simplistic zombies yet maps really good love zombies game best zombies treyarch game verdict game mostly people want play campaign zombies muiltiplayer good game players servers would given game give game good needs work muiltiplayer

"I spent a better part of my childhood playing this game, back before Steam became the ubiqitious gaming medium (read: Valve's money-making lovechild) for 'shut up and take my damn money'. How can I describe this game? What one phrase summarizes the ostensive thrust of epic time sink that is Counter-Strike?   Easy - 'just one more round!' And the whirlpool of regret washes over you as dusk turns to dawn and you realize that you didn't study for your freakin' biology exam. For shame. Too bad this box isn't large enough to contain my stories of grand LAN parties. Needless to say, this was an amazing game.  Though after years passing, the humor lies in sadness that the same 13 year olds that I left behind are still playing.. Worse yet, they're being domineered by server admins who are exactly 1 year older! (I figure a bedtime extension merits you the ability to ban &amp; kick players).  So yeah, before the new CS comes out, spend some time acquainting yourself with this FPS tour de force.",1,spent better part childhood playing game back steam became ubiqitious gaming medium read valves moneymaking lovechild shut take damn money describe game one phrase summarizes ostensive thrust epic time sink counterstrike easy one round whirlpool regret washes dusk turns dawn realize didnt study freakin biology exam shame bad box isnt large enough contain stories grand lan parties needless say amazing game though years passing humor lies sadness year olds left behind still playing worse yet theyre domineered server admins exactly year older figure bedtime extension merits ability ban amp kick players yeah new cs comes spend time acquainting fps tour de force
"This game is absolutely amazing. Many people consider it the last good cod came, and I wont say their wrong. The campaign is intense, although quite gory. The only downside i have founde is that almost every multiplayer server is hacked so you can barely play. The primary reason I got this game was for zombies. Well, custom zombies. If you didn't know, you can download maps as a mod and play them. You could also make them, but thats extremely difficult. Overall, this is a great game and worth every penny.",1,game absolutely amazing many people consider last good cod came wont say wrong campaign intense although quite gory downside founde almost every multiplayer server hacked barely play primary reason got game zombies well custom zombies didnt know download maps mod play could also make thats extremely difficult overall great game worth every penny

"Showing a commitment to portraying the horrors of World War II with graphic realism, Call of Duty: World at War is proof that maybe Treyarch abandoned the 1940s war setting far too soon. With the series now being oversaturated with modern and futuristic warfare games populated by brown-haired burly white dudes that all look and sound the same, World at War has a rather diverse cast of characters who you feel like you can care about. After Treyarch finishes making Black Ops 16, they should really consider going back to the Allies v. Axis era.",1,showing commitment portraying horrors world war ii graphic realism call duty world war proof maybe treyarch abandoned war setting far soon series oversaturated modern futuristic warfare games populated brownhaired burly white dudes look sound world war rather diverse cast characters feel like care treyarch finishes making black ops really consider going back allies v axis era

This call of duty is one of the best so far in my opinion. Sure now anymore you can only find some people on a server here and there but the best expirience you will have on World at War is the zombies. With thousands of custom maps up for grabs there is almost never a time when you are bored of zombies. The one thing I wish was that this game was paired with steams workshop. It would make it easier then having to search hours on google for a map that one of your favorite Youtubers played. But besides that I really enjoyed this game and up to this day the game still has a lot of potential. Thats coming from a game that a little more then 6 years old!,1,call duty one best far opinion sure anymore find people server best expirience world war zombies thousands custom maps grabs almost never time bored zombies one thing wish game paired steams workshop would make easier search hours google map one favorite youtubers played besides really enjoyed game day game still lot potential thats coming game little years old

As you know, this game is a modification of Half-Life by developers and it's a multiplayer first-person shooter. You don't have iron sight how you have in CoD or other shooter games + you need to know the weapons because they don't shoot where is the aim. It's hard to explain, but this game has so many modes and is awesome because if you buy this game, you will receive Counter-Strike Condition Zero and Condition Zero Deleted Scenes for FREE. You can play a normal shooter games with instant respawn or without it, but you can also play deathrun, surf, bhop, gun game, zombies and so on.

"This is in my opinion, the best call of duty every made. nearly 7 years later and it is still the game that I find myself going back to. Treyarch did a phenomical job, and the WW2 era is something that I sorely miss in today's games. Not to mention that this introduced the world famous zombie modes. Some of the free zombie mods are worlds better than what you can get as paid dlc, or even full games from other sources or consoles. They really outdid themselves with this game. Heres to hoping for a W@W 2 this fall!",1,opinion best call duty every made nearly years later still game find going back treyarch phenomical job ww era something sorely miss todays games mention introduced world famous zombie modes free zombie mods worlds better get paid dlc even full games sources consoles really outdid game heres hoping ww fall

welcome to cod a game populated by lonely 40 year old men hoping to fufill their dreams of joining an army (you could join a militia at the age of 5 in my home land) the lonely 40 year olds playing this game can be very volatile because one time I was doing a joint co-op mission with these gay lords and suddenly they started screaming at me '2 IS DOWN' I was very confused because I have absolutely no clue who 2 is and why he is down so I decided that was enough and so I started screaming at them 'IS THERE A XBOX VERSION OF THIS?' whilst typing that I was guzzling a 4l bottle of mtn dew and also crunching on a 50kg bag of chilli heatwave doritos and came to the swift conclusion i'm not better than the people i'm offending.  So I decided to join the local army only to have my leg blown off by an IED and then die.  5/10 - halo is way better with grafixs and simulotion also THERE IS TOO MANY VEHICLES IN THIS GAME!!!!!!!!,-1,welcome cod game populated lonely year old men hoping fufill dreams joining army could join militia age home land lonely year olds playing game volatile one time joint coop mission gay lords suddenly started screaming confused absolutely clue decided enough started screaming xbox version whilst typing guzzling l bottle mtn dew also crunching kg bag chilli heatwave doritos came swift conclusion im better people im offending decided join local army leg blown ied die halo way better grafixs simulotion also many vehicles game

"BEHOLD! The Call of Duty game that not only gave a great story line and a also great multiplayer. But gave what the world needed in a Call of Duty game... Zombie. Survival. That, my good sir, is how this game is recommended dearly at its cheap to me price. Call of Duty: World at War is a game that adds not One, not even Two, but THREE different ways to experience it. The story line takes place in World War II where you take place as Private C. Miller, as Private Miller, you fight the Japanese and Germans while being in both the American military and the Soviet army. You fight along with Dimitri to overcome the opponents in your way and win a war. Multiplayer is also taken place in the same time, you have multiple gamemodes such as Capture the Flag, Team DeathMatch, DeathMatch, ect... fighting the opposing online players in a battle to win the match, it's always amusing to get onto multiplayer matches and shoot through a couple heads with a Springfield. Multiplayer is fun and all, but that's not everything, there is also a Zombie mode which I told you about before, it has you and up to 3 other people held up in one of three missions, Nacht Der Toten, Der Rise, and Vurruct. The object of the Zombie mode is to shoot some zombies that break through the barriers of the room that you start in, continuing to get points by either shooting zombies or repairing the barriers they break down, you use the points you achieve and open other doors and get more useful weapons, you survive as much rounds as possible without dying by the hordes of zombies that are swinging at you.

"Counter-Strike has come a long way and to see this game really brings out how much it has come. I feel as this game is not just a time waster but a reason to still be on the Internet. But In 1999, I crawled out of Counter-Strike’s wretched ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to become the man I am today. And, now, I’m tasked with rating the game. How does one even rate his mother?  In sixth grade, I would wake up for school at 5:30 AM, but then I started getting up at 4:30 just to get a couple rounds in before class. Call it dedication or a sickening obsession, but I was hooked on CS (nevermind my neighbor who broke into my house to play while I slept!) It was more than a game. It was my social hub, my iTunes visualizer, and my brief entryway into game design (which didn’t go very far.) It is and remains a standout multiplayer shooter that paved the way for things to come with Call of Duty and Battlefield.  Being eight years since the excellent Source remake, Valve has decided it’s time to give the game another facelift. What started as a Source port for consoles became a more ambitious project that included PC. While there are no radical departures in Global Offensive, it is without a doubt a reboot. Valve has just hit the reset button on the series, once again. As drastic and premature of a maneuver it may be, there is no denying that Counter-Strike remains an addictive and rewarding competitive shooter like no other.

"I don't care about Zombies. Yes I said it. Don't care. Now that that's out of the way, let's review this thing.  I love COD: World at War. Many people hate it for reasons that I understand and respect but I think it is fantastic. Frankly I feel that this is the definitve World War II video game that I had always been wanting to play and when I played it for the first time, boy did it deliver. PC was actually not my first platform for this game though. Finals week the Spring of 2009, all I did with a group of friends was trade of studying and playing COOP Call of Duty. It was epic of truly epic proportions. But through all academic stress out, another truth came through. This was the WWII game I had been wanting to play ever since my parents let me buy Medal of Honor: Allied Assault so many years ago. It was intense, featured all the weapons I wanted to see, had a fun story that kept building, had tanks, frakin airplane gunner mission, and most especially featured the US Marines (Love the Army but I'm a US Marines guy through and through).  Yes it has its issues, but I see them as standard Call of Duty issues and nothing that unique or game changing. If you are familiar with Call of Duty you know what you're getting here. I think the negative vibe surrounding opinion about this game just comes down to bad timing. It came out during a time when people were just tired of WWII subject matter. Call of Duty Modern Warfare had come out and the world was ready for different material. Be that as it may though, this one is a gem and well worth the buy.",1,dont care zombies yes said dont care thats way lets review thing love cod world war many people hate reasons understand respect think fantastic frankly feel definitve world war ii video game always wanting play played first time boy deliver pc actually first platform game though finals week spring group friends trade studying playing coop call duty epic truly epic proportions academic stress another truth came wwii game wanting play ever since parents let buy medal honor allied assault many years ago intense featured weapons wanted see fun story kept building tanks frakin airplane gunner mission especially featured us marines love army im us marines guy yes issues see standard call duty issues nothing unique game changing familiar call duty know youre getting think negative vibe surrounding opinion game comes bad timing came time people tired wwii subject matter call duty modern warfare come world ready different material may though one gem well worth buy

"Call of duty World at War is a very good call of duty. This is another WWII CoD. In the main campaign you play as an american and a russian as you go randomly between them. Im not going to talk about the story line but it is sorta sad at the end. Multiplayer doesnt matter because those people have hacked by now or are just gods and stuff :P In the zombies game mode (which you get by compleating the campaign or by playing it online) you can play as 1 of 4 people in the group (you dont get the group until the map called shi no numa in the ones before your just army doods :P) 1st player (host) is tank dempsey american, 2nd player is Nikolai belenski russian (vodka lover) 3rd player (is bad and you should feel bad) is takeo japanese or something, and 4th player (my favorite caractor) is DR.EDWARD RICHTOFEN. With out Richtofen there would be no zombie story line. That is all of Call of Duty: World at War i can talk about.

Despite it's 2008 release date, this CoD game remains the winner of the best CoD (My opinion, don't get your ♥♥♥♥ into a twist) due to the harshness of the war, the astounding (Not entirely hacked) Multiplayer, and my personal favorite, Nazi zombies. While this game may have been made in 2008 don't think the community is dead, daily custom zombie maps are being made which offers unlimited replayability meaning that for a 2008 game, it has more content than all the other CoD's put together. The multi-player is also amazing, if you choose a non hacked lobby I guarantee you will have an awesome time on it, without having to worry about all those 10-13 year olds who 'sleep' with your mom. As for the campaign, it puts you in the place of different people fighting on different sides during WW2, it is harsh, bloody, and total hell on veteran difficulty. Perfect for gorehounds like me who like a challenge :) . There should be no reason to not pick this game up if you have the funds. Since for $20 it has offered 200 and counting hours of fun gameplay. Anyway, why are you still reading this review, stop and buy WaW you c,unt. :p   (I still play this game and I don't mind receiving requests from people who would like to play -edit 7/16/16)",1,call duty world war best cod hands despite release date cod game remains winner best cod opinion dont get twist due harshness war astounding entirely hacked multiplayer personal favorite nazi zombies game may made dont think community dead daily custom zombie maps made offers unlimited replayability meaning game content cods put together multiplayer also amazing choose non hacked lobby guarantee awesome time without worry year olds sleep mom campaign puts place different people fighting different sides ww harsh bloody total hell veteran difficulty perfect gorehounds like like challenge reason pick game funds since offered counting hours fun gameplay anyway still reading review stop buy waw cunt p still play game dont mind receiving requests people would like play edit

"Graphics aren't the greatest, but don't let looks stop you from playing this game. Campaign is fun (especially with friends) although there aren't many memorable moments. Multiplayer isn't as unbalanced as Modern Warfare 2, and surprsiignly still a community that plays the game. Sure, plenty of servers have mods, but try them out. They might add something you enjoy. And of course, there's nazi zombies. There are hundreds of community made maps on the internet to play, some absolutely awful, while others are better than anything the original developers could pull off. If you like Call of Duty and haven't played this, it's not too late.

Its zombie mode was the first of the series that black ops one and so on I hope will continue to use for years to come. Also the multiplayer is create and is semi-comparable to DOD (Day of Defeat). Also I love the multi-player in this game just because there are tanks in it that ARE NOT KILLSTREAK and no call of duties I have seen don't have any vehicles that are available without killing enough enemies in a row without dieing. All in all I would say buy the game if you like custom maps and killing zombies. One downfall is the lack of players now-a-days.

"There is nothing quite like this game, a classic arcade shooter where the maps are perfectly balanced with players fighting over certain points even if there isn't an objective, the guns all feel well made and just as deadly as they are in real life. Nothing beats the gore of throwing a perfectly cooked grenade and seeing the limbs of your foes fly across your screen. The game holds a perfect upbeat rythm without making it feel to repetitive, which isn't pretty common nowadays. It is easy to be dragged into playing for hours and you never have a dull moment. The campaign is a highlight of the CoD series and I feel is always trying to be recreated in the recent titles. I used to play this game a lot on console when I was younger and I saw it fall to hackers when the new title was released and support was dropped, but I saw to my surprise that on PC there are many dedicated servers running hacker free games and they are full of players pretty much all day.

"2015-04-26 - Call of Duty: World at War (WaW), like most of the Call of Duty (CoD) series, is really two games, with a single-player campaign and multi-player shoot-em-up both of the first person shooter variety.  By the time I purchased this game, the multi-player environment had largely evaporated, so I cannot review the game from that perspective.  The single-player campaign follows the exploits of two characters in a World War II setting: an American marine in the Pacific and a Russion recruit on the eastern front. The game was interesting enough, with dramatic moments in which you can get swept up. The large-scale firefights with Sgt. Reznov were, in particular, exhilerating as Reznov yells encouragements and the music swells.  Unfortunately, there are several choke-points in the game that can be frustrating to work through. The enemy sniper in Vendetta was especially annoying. The sniper runs around, poking his head out of random windows and taking lethal shots in an instant on the harder difficulty levels. It doesn't matter if you hide and slowly crawl to a new position. No, he knows exactly where you are and will kill you instantly unless you beat him to the punch. There isn't any value in pulling yourself into the shadows at the back of the room and waiting for him to get sloppy. Again, he knows exactly where you are and will kill you instantly unless you beat his shot.  And, therein, lies the main problem with WaW and the CoD series in general: there is often only one right way to do things and you either figure it out or you follow the prompts, which may or may not be obvious, or you get to beat your head against a wall until you realize the puppeteer wants you to do a jig and not The Twist. I am generally wary of scripted action but it can work if it flows and is intuitive. When it isn't, well, it feels like you are being punished for not following a process document you were never made aware of.  The single-player campaign doesn't have quite the hard script that later entries have and so I give the game a tepid thumbs up for that reason. The multi-player options are quite limited without some work. I would encourage a look at a different game if multi-player is what you're looking for.",1,call duty world war waw like call duty cod series really two games singleplayer campaign multiplayer shootemup first person shooter variety time purchased game multiplayer environment largely evaporated cannot review game perspective singleplayer campaign follows exploits two characters world war ii setting american marine pacific russion recruit eastern front game interesting enough dramatic moments get swept largescale firefights sgt reznov particular exhilerating reznov yells encouragements music swells unfortunately several chokepoints game frustrating work enemy sniper vendetta especially annoying sniper runs around poking head random windows taking lethal shots instant harder difficulty levels doesnt matter hide slowly crawl new position knows exactly kill instantly unless beat punch isnt value pulling shadows back room waiting get sloppy knows exactly kill instantly unless beat shot therein lies main problem waw cod series general often one right way things either figure follow prompts may may obvious get beat head wall realize puppeteer wants jig twist generally wary scripted action work flows intuitive isnt well feels like punished following process document never made aware singleplayer campaign doesnt quite hard script later entries give game tepid thumbs reason multiplayer options quite limited without work would encourage look different game multiplayer youre looking

"This game STILL continue to live on, but why was that? Well it was quite due to that fact that CS:Source isn't that much like by the pros since 2004 as CS:S as quoted: 'Too easy' and such, so the match for cs 1.6 grew more and more and that it was so hyped and praised and good, it still have matches even after 10 years of its 1.6 release (2003 - 2013) in which just kind of died out for CS:GO, but still, because of it's core gameplay and the fact that the commuity has been long just playing this multiplayer long and long and long, it is a game that will take long to die out, since it has a strong community base for it.  Since this game has been, well for long, then you should commonly see the use of wallhacking, cheats, aimbot, fake servers been used today, and the fact that there are quite a lot of empty servers now, but there are populated servers that are good and good community, but there are part of the community been off ever since.  It is seem a bit late to just buy and play this game, but it is still great to check it out if you are new to the cs series, or otherwise if you don't have GNU/Linux (In which I have), then you can buy Counter Strike : Globle Offensive anyway, since it is newer and (I think) has more players and pros playing it now. But if you want to have this raw action, then cs 1.6/cz would be great, you can get the bundle too if you want source as well, but source is fun to play as well.  Verdict: 9.5/10 - It still holds it place.",1,game still continue live well quite due fact cssource isnt much like pros since css quoted easy match cs grew hyped praised good still matches even years release kind died csgo still core gameplay fact commuity long playing multiplayer long long long game take long die since strong community base since game well long commonly see use wallhacking cheats aimbot fake servers used today fact quite lot empty servers populated servers good good community part community ever since seem bit late buy play game still great check new cs series otherwise dont gnulinux buy counter strike globle offensive anyway since newer think players pros playing want raw action cs cz would great get bundle want source well source fun play well verdict still holds place

"The second best Call of Duty ever made and one of the last good remaining ones. Call of Duty: World at War is not a masterpiece but it is a damn good game. The gameplay is simply COD4 with a different era. Its fun, fast, and arcadie. The single player is alright with a couple of interesting characters. Nothing worth praising here but a lot of enjoyment is to be had from the campaing.  Multiplayer is still alive and active. The servers are very fun to play in and have a lot of active players on them. WaW's multiplayer is very fun and solid. It may have a couple of cheap moments like any other COD has. But it is still very enjoyable and can keep you entertained for a couple of hours.  As always I leave the best for last. Zombies! Call of Duty: World at War's zombie mode is one of the best co-op experiences I have ever had. Its fun, gameplay is solid, theres a story, and it will give you and your friends hours upon hours of entertainment. The game comes with 4 solid maps to play on. Natch Der Untoten, Verruckt, Shi No Numa, and Der Riese. These maps offer great variety and are very fun to play in. Zombies is the biggest and most alive part of this game. With a community that has created thousands upon thousands of custom zombie maps that one can enjoy. Many map makers like ZCT and TMG provide high quality maps that can be compared to Treyarch's best.   You still reading eh? Go and buy this game NOW! Yeah thats right, NOW! This is a game everyone should have in their libraries as it offers many hours of entertainment. Like stated before this is the 2nd best Call of Duty to be made. I give this game a 9.5/10 as it truly deserves that score.",1,second best call duty ever made one last good remaining ones call duty world war masterpiece damn good game gameplay simply cod different era fun fast arcadie single player alright couple interesting characters nothing worth praising lot enjoyment campaing multiplayer still alive active servers fun play lot active players waws multiplayer fun solid may couple cheap moments like cod still enjoyable keep entertained couple hours always leave best last zombies call duty world wars zombie mode one best coop experiences ever fun gameplay solid theres story give friends hours upon hours entertainment game comes solid maps play natch der untoten verruckt shi numa der riese maps offer great variety fun play zombies biggest alive part game community created thousands upon thousands custom zombie maps one enjoy many map makers like zct tmg provide high quality maps compared treyarchs best still reading eh go buy game yeah thats right game everyone libraries offers many hours entertainment like stated nd best call duty made give game truly deserves score

This is my favorite Call Of Duty. I know its an older Call Of Duty compared to how the engine for the game has evolved. But it was the last Call Of Duty to be based in WWII. I like WWII shooters and its sad to see few of them being made these days. I first owned this game on Xbox 360 and played it for hours with friends and other online in lobbies. Now only was the Multiplayer great the campaign was well done as well. Many in 2015 still play this game online and even when this game dies online you can download this  bot  mod that allows you to play with AI Bot in multiplayer and it works well! And this was the first Call Of Duty to feature its famous Nazi Zombies mod. I didn’t even expected this game mode when I got the game. Once I unlocked it I was in loved with it and it made me feel like I got two games on one. A Zombie game and a WWII shooter. My opinion though on Call Of Duty games made after this wasn’t themed well especially the Black Ops series since it dragged out some of the World At War characters and I wasn’t a fan of the newer Zombies in Black Ops and felt they added so much it wasn’t the same anymore. This is my favorite Call Of Duty and most likely will always be my favorite Call Of Duty. I recommend it for the Zombies and in 2015 many here do play Zombies on the PC in Call Of Duty – World At War still even though the game is several years old. And If you like a good WWII shooter this game is for you.,1,favorite call duty know older call duty compared engine game evolved last call duty based wwii like wwii shooters sad see made days first owned game xbox played hours friends online lobbies multiplayer great campaign well done well many still play game online even game dies online download bot mod allows play ai bot multiplayer works well first call duty feature famous nazi zombies mod didnt even expected game mode got game unlocked loved made feel like got two games one zombie game wwii shooter opinion though call duty games made wasnt themed well especially black ops series since dragged world war characters wasnt fan newer zombies black ops felt added much wasnt anymore favorite call duty likely always favorite call duty recommend zombies many play zombies pc call duty world war still even though game several years old like good wwii shooter game

"I'm not really a Call of Duty fan, nor a Zombies/Survival Genre fan, but I found this game alright.   Pros:     Large modding community, the main grab of the game for me being the custom zombies maps, which there are many of. You can even play these maps multiplayer, so long as everyone has it installed.    Still quite popular today.    Very good fun with friends - either the multiplayer (as in 1v1, 2v2 etc) or Zombies.    Multiplayer would be good if you haven't played CoD before, but for those who have, more likely a grind.    Cons:     Horrible graphics. The game has some sort of effect or colour palette that, sure makes it realistic and alike WW2, but also makes me feel nauseous and uncomfortable. Before you say 'It's an old game' - I've played OLDER games with lower budgets yet much better graphics.    Very repetitive. Look up Grind in a dictionary and Call of Duty's picture will be there, along with World of Warcraft.     Only fun with friends. If you don't know anyone with this game, don't buy it. The Zombies is the best part and that can't really be played Solo with much enjoyment. (unless you are unsocial and like that sort of thing???)   Overall a good game to play with friends, but not that fun alone. Graphics are the main fault for me, even at a high resoloution the game still looks worse than minesweeper...  6/10",1,im really call duty fan zombiessurvival genre fan found game alright pros large modding community main grab game custom zombies maps many even play maps multiplayer long everyone installed still quite popular today good fun friends either multiplayer v v etc zombies multiplayer would good havent played cod likely grind cons horrible graphics game sort effect colour palette sure makes realistic alike ww also makes feel nauseous uncomfortable say old game ive played older games lower budgets yet much better graphics repetitive look grind dictionary call dutys picture along world warcraft fun friends dont know anyone game dont buy zombies best part cant really played solo much enjoyment unless unsocial like sort thing overall good game play friends fun alone graphics main fault even high resoloution game still looks worse minesweeper

"  Idk how I received the product but when I was checking my library I saw this game. I've already played it (I had non-steam version) and I can judge the game  Many people think that it is 'last Call of Duty' etc... I disagree. For me the last CoDs are MW2 and MW3 (they were one of the best games I've ever played, you don't know how interesting it was).  Let's review the game lol nobody wants to know about my feelings.   The 1st and the most important part - graphical part. It is quite good and for 2008 it was very good. Nobody can expect smth better from a 2009 y game.  The gameplay - Call of Duty. Many enemies run, many enemies are killed by you, many allies shoot somewhere nobody knows where. The gameplay is quite good, but it is bad if all the games the devs made have simillar gameplay  The plot - is also good. My favourite part in the game is Soviet one where action is really action.   Maybe somebody still thinking: 'huh do I need to buy this lol the game from 2008'. I'd like to advise: buy it. Anyway you can return the money you paid.",1,idk received product checking library saw game ive already played nonsteam version judge game many people think last call duty etc disagree last cods mw mw one best games ive ever played dont know interesting lets review game lol nobody wants know feelings st important part graphical part quite good good nobody expect smth better game gameplay call duty many enemies run many enemies killed many allies shoot somewhere nobody knows gameplay quite good bad games devs made simillar gameplay plot also good favourite part game soviet one action really action maybe somebody still thinking huh need buy lol game id like advise buy anyway return money paid

"To this day, Call of Duty: World at War still holds up as one of the greatest first person shooters of all time. To give a full perspective on the game, I will do this review in three parts:  Campaign: Probably the weakest aspect of the game, but still fun to run around play through World War II environments. Its story feels a bit less personal and epic as some of the other titles (Modern Warfare, Black Ops), however it isn't by any means bad and can still be enjoyed. The mechanics of the campaign can be somewhat odd, with things like random grenade spawning which cause a bit of annoyance. But, on the whole it's still a fun time. World at War also has a co-op campaign feature, something that has not been seen since in the series.  Multiplayer: This is where World at War really shines. In general, the game is designed around being skill based, and as such you are rewarded for being a good player. Now, that doesn't mean there isn't the occasional iffy mechanic in the game (martyrdom), however most of the time you earn your kills and deserve your deaths. The TTK (time to kill) is higher than other games, making gun accurasy and controlling recoil key. The game has generally very strong maps (Castle, Cliffside, Downfall, Nightfire etc.), and each map generally accomidates to a variety of skill sets and has a variety of sightlines (again, reinforcing good aim and gun control being rewarded). All in all, this game has a near perfect multiplayer and to this day remains a great experience.   Bonus - Zombies: Although Zombies has come to be expected out of modern Treyarch Call of Duty titles, in World at War it was a hidden bonus mode that caught on like wildfire. That's right, World at War is where this whole zombies craze started. There are 4 zombies maps in total (although you can download additional countless ones via user created maps), including my personal favorite map Zombies map ever, Der Riese. However, every map is enjoyable. The biggest weakness in World at War's Zombies is the zombie grab, which can often cause frustration and being automatically down with no chance to get away. However, if you're good enough, you can avoid this for the most part. Although future games are more refined (and brought these maps back), World at War Zombies is still an incredibly enjoyable experience, and has an endless amount of mod content.   Extra and Closing Thoughts: As I mentioned in the Zombies section, there is a wealth of moddable content for this game. This includes maps, guns, skins, modes etc., essentially creating a game you can spend an infinite amount of time and never be bored. In addition, PC players got ALL of World at War's DLC Content for free! However, it is worth noting that the community [as of mid 2014, 5.5 years after release] is slowly dying out, and you could eventually run into an issue finding a desireable game. That being said, this is an excellent game, one of my personal favorite FPS games of all time, and I highly recommend picking it up!",1,day call duty world war still holds one greatest first person shooters time give full perspective game review three parts campaign probably weakest aspect game still fun run around play world war ii environments story feels bit less personal epic titles modern warfare black ops however isnt means bad still enjoyed mechanics campaign somewhat odd things like random grenade spawning cause bit annoyance whole still fun time world war also coop campaign feature something seen since series multiplayer world war really shines general game designed around skill based rewarded good player doesnt mean isnt occasional iffy mechanic game martyrdom however time earn kills deserve deaths ttk time kill higher games making gun accurasy controlling recoil key game generally strong maps castle cliffside downfall nightfire etc map generally accomidates variety skill sets variety sightlines reinforcing good aim gun control rewarded game near perfect multiplayer day remains great experience bonus zombies although zombies come expected modern treyarch call duty titles world war hidden bonus mode caught like wildfire thats right world war whole zombies craze started zombies maps total although download additional countless ones via user created maps including personal favorite map zombies map ever der riese however every map enjoyable biggest weakness world wars zombies zombie grab often cause frustration automatically chance get away however youre good enough avoid part although future games refined brought maps back world war zombies still incredibly enjoyable experience endless amount mod content extra closing thoughts mentioned zombies section wealth moddable content game includes maps guns skins modes etc essentially creating game spend infinite amount time never bored addition pc players got world wars dlc content free however worth noting community mid years release slowly dying could eventually run issue finding desireable game said excellent game one personal favorite fps games time highly recommend picking

The singleplayer is tons of fun as you jump in the shoes of US soldier Pvt. Miller, who has to fight the Japanese in insane and heartpouning missions, and you get to play as Pvt. Dimtri Petrenko who has to fight the germans alongside with Reznov who is a complete badass in intense missions. Multiplayer is also great, but it really depends on if you like multiplayer games.

"Call of Duty: World at War, sure you'd be correct if you called it 'old'. But you gotta hear me out, this game is amazing when you play a custom zombies map. 'What is a custom zombies map?' you may be asking, well allow me to show you the capabilities that these amazing modders (e.g. ZK,HexZombies and many more, even my good friend monkey is making a map) can do, some maps include ported weapons, (e.g. RaygunMK2, Peacekeeper, intervention, any other gun you can think of) which is basically bringing a gun from a diffrent COD or even a diffrent shooter game into COD:WaW, there can also be, Custom zombie models, custom weapon 'camos' or models, or even custom playermodels (e.g. Cheesecube Unlimited -by ZK your playermodel can change to 'Iron Man' when you put on a suit [and you do get to use the repulsors and rockets c: ]) This may already seem like a long review but trust me, if you get this game and download a few custom maps, you won't be sorry.   My rating: 20/10   Final note: If you purchase this game but need someone to play with you can add me I play this game quite often. If you need help downloading/installing custom maps you can message me and I can show you a youtube video that can assist you in downloading/installing custom maps. Good day to everyone, And happy gaming!    ~~~EDIT~~~  Now the reson i needed to edit this is just to let you know, you won't find very many (if any) Zombie matches that are open to the public, BUT if you need someone to play this game with You can add me (ingame name is 'Link-Zelda') or a few of my friends (ign's 'jose09monkey' or 'z506yy' withought quotes of course) you will find some zombie matches listed under the 'mp' list (aka open multiplayer and search for zombie matches there) but still not many.

Both sides of it are amazing although I enjoy the Russian side of it more. The multiplayer is fun even though it's kind of dying out. But the best part is the zombie mods. I haven't even played much zombies yet but so far its amazing. Add in the fact that mods and maps are STILL being created adds to the fact that there is so much replayability.

"With a still strong and kicking Modding Community, i'd recommend this game, but sololy as a Zombie game.

The Campaign is fantastic, but hardly worth the $20 this game is at regularly on its own.   It does have a few flaws, crashes can happen often, and it does have a tendency to start in 800x600 on startup. But nevertheless, it is still a good game, and I'd say pick it up for &lt;$10.

The real call of duty. Like ffs the reason the games are called 'Call Of Duty' is beacuse you are 'Called to duty' or in other words called to fight for what is right or what ever reason there is  in the new call of dutys ghosts up there is no real world saving reason why you fight now advanced warfare you were fighting for a reason but we all know that game is ♥♥♥♥ but besides that point. The call of duty franchise is/ was based on world war because you were called to fight in it not control ♥♥♥♥ing space dogs no if new call of duty games had great story telling but with ♥♥♥♥ mechaics i would not mind black ops 2 was the last good call of duty because it was not too far into the futrure but not a year too modern either but however the reason this game is still loved is because of the modibility of it. which is amazing because you could have every call of duty in the one game now for this game i give it 10/10 it is a true call of duty shooter if you want a shooter that feels like real war get this and ffs there is gore in multiplayer !the reason there is gore is beacuse it was not intended for kids thats why they removed gore in the new games I hope the next call of duty is a world war game or a complete zombie survival kind of game but not a ♥♥♥♥ way more like a story driven way and for the world war theme you ight think 'oh world war is so overused what are you going to do make the same game with better graphics' yes and also the war was very long over 4 and a half years ♥♥♥♥ happened between then so you can either A.) base it off lesser know facts or B.) have new set of people to base the story around it could be a squadern deployed behind enemy lines trying to survive while trying to make contact to get backup while trying to defeat the enemys hell you could even have it from a nazi's view wether he was good or bad if he was forced to join or not. the truth be told the call of duty series has gone to ♥♥♥♥ if they put extra time into making the game even if it is a year extra do it because there is so much they could go on    TL:DR the series has gone to ♥♥♥♥ besides black ops 2 and before this game though is the best  Also if you want so opinions on the games read the whole thing  ALSO BEFORE YOU HATE SAYING 'YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE 100 HOURS ON THIS GAME ' I have played all the games on console first before getting them on pc i have over 1000 hrs on each . If you have differnt opinions feel free to mention them by comenting on this review   Also if you want a good call of duty with good replayability buy thos cod game cuase it is a real call of duty,1,real call duty like ffs reason games called call duty beacuse called duty words called fight right ever reason new call dutys ghosts real world saving reason fight advanced warfare fighting reason know game besides point call duty franchise based world war called fight control ing space dogs new call duty games great story telling mechaics would mind black ops last good call duty far futrure year modern either however reason game still loved modibility amazing could every call duty one game game give true call duty shooter want shooter feels like real war get ffs gore multiplayer reason gore beacuse intended kids thats removed gore new games hope next call duty world war game complete zombie survival kind game way like story driven way world war theme ight think oh world war overused going make game better graphics yes also war long half years happened either base lesser know facts b new set people base story around could squadern deployed behind enemy lines trying survive trying make contact get backup trying defeat enemys hell could even nazis view wether good bad forced join truth told call duty series gone put extra time making game even year extra much could go tldr series gone besides black ops game though best also want opinions games read whole thing also hate saying dont even hours game played games console first getting pc hrs differnt opinions feel free mention comenting review also want good call duty good replayability buy thos cod game cuase real call duty

"Addictive, dull, and repetitive, Counter-Strike will eat up hours that you'll want to have back. There are two newer iterations of this game now, both of which are similarly wasteful of time. While one might argue that any game is not a productive use of one's days, Counter-Strike ranks one step above almost anything out there: unless you're freakishly good or an inveterate camper, you'll spend the lion's share of your gameplay idly waiting to respawn. More, you'll inevitably (especially in 1.6) run into players so good that you'll be unsure whether they're superlative gamers or superlative cheaters.

Pros: - excellent campaign (although short on story) - A multiplayer deviod of annoying preteens and jerks, plus balanced perks and guns (minus a few exceptions e.g. MP40) - Zombies, 'nuff said - Custom Zombies, 'nuff said  Cons: - At this point, you'll rarely find someone online playing zombies or co-op/comp. campaign, so unless you've got a good amount of friends who own this game, you'll be stuck playing solo - YOU NOT OWNING THIS GAME!!!

"Great game! I started with source, and felt that this was going to be a downgrade. After playing for about four minutes, I learned how competitive the game was. I learned I wasn't good at the game, and trained for once. That was something I had never done on Counter-Strike: source.  Now it's time to talk about the bad things: First of all, although there are more servers than TFC has, there is still hardly any servers. You can find a server and join it, but most of the servers have custom maps and free guns. Obviously the graphics are a downgrade, but who plays games for graphics? I sure as hell don't. And for the year 2000 the graphics are great!  There is a misconception with this game where people think that Bunnyhopping is still in the game. It's not. They removed it in 1.4 and it is now 1.6.  Overall, BUY THIS GAME!",1,great game started source felt going downgrade playing four minutes learned competitive game learned wasnt good game trained something never done counterstrike source time talk bad things first although servers tfc still hardly servers find server join servers custom maps free guns obviously graphics downgrade plays games graphics sure hell dont year graphics great misconception game people think bunnyhopping still game removed overall buy game

"I really just bought this game for the Nazi Zombies mode, and holy BALLS, does it ever deliver! In addition to having rock bottom minimum system requirements, playing Call of Duty on PC with a keyboard and mouse just feels absolutely perfect. And as if that wasn't enough, all four maps for Nazi Zombies mode are included! Not sure I'd be able to justify paying full price for this game (the less money you have to give Activision and Treyarch, the better), but DEFINITELY pick it up if it ever goes on sale! Long story short, this game is absolutely worth playing, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone who like FPS games on PC.",1,really bought game nazi zombies mode holy balls ever deliver addition rock bottom minimum system requirements playing call duty pc keyboard mouse feels absolutely perfect wasnt enough four maps nazi zombies mode included sure id able justify paying full price game less money give activision treyarch better definitely pick ever goes sale long story short game absolutely worth playing would certainly recommend anyone like fps games pc

"Comparing the game to CS:GO.    Pros:      Variation in lighting (darker rooms), along with flashlights and nightvision.    No background/ambient sounds in most maps (clear sound) (easier to hear footsteps and gunfire).    You can wallbang most things/walls in most maps.    Buying amunition (more depth in economical strategy).    MP5 ('nuff said)    Movement is much smoother and bunnyhopping is much more consistant and fluent, you feel much heavier in cs:go.    You can run the game on a toaster.    Character selection (I just think its pretty awesome).    Spraying (spray paint), boobs make for a great strategical distraction.    Customizing textures, maps, models ect. is great, you can mod almost anything you want, unlike in CS:GO.    No marketing system (skins), this one is a bit of a debate, personally I'm ok with skins (I've even spent money on it myself), but I prefer to mod a game rather than having to pay for a nice looking gun. Skins, simply put, are a way to milk the players money. Im thankful that CS 1.6 doesn't have this.    CS 1.6 has a classic/nostalgic feel to it, some people will like that, some people won't.    People still play the game, proving the game isn't dead yet.    There are many different and interesting modded game modes in 1.6 such as surfing, zombie, bunny hopping, jailbreak, deathmatch, gungame.     Cons:      Matchmaking in CS:GO is better, it is simpler and places you in a server with people around your level.    Grenade physics are awkward and hard to learn.    Viewing and casting games is much better/easier in CS:GO.    Few weapons are viable in CS 1.6, mostly just the AK, M4, AWP, Deagle and MP5    Sometimes bad/terrible hit registration.    Tactical shield.    No ranking system, personally, I don't care about having a pretty symbols with a bunch of arrows and stars, or having stupid rank names like 'SERGEANT MASTER ELITE SHOOTER PERSON', the only reason I'm putting it on this list is because ranking helps put players with other players that are about the level. In 1.6, any new player will find themselves playing against people leagues better than said player.    I did mention before that modded servers were great, but it can also be a problem, there are few classic CS 1.6 servers that aren't modded, most of them being deathmatch servers with 32 players, it's hard to find normal CS game modes.    Hacking is a issue in CS 1.6, worse than in CS:GO. It's harder to get VAC Banned in 1.6 and there aren't any features like Overwatch in CS:GO, to make it easier to detect hackers.    Servers can change your bindings and send you to other servers, this isn't a big problem as there are ways around it but it's still present.    The game no longer gets any updates, I know this isn't the games fault but there are still exploits and bugs in 1.6.   Some people will agree these pros and cons and some won't. I'm not saying this game is necessarily better than CS:GO, but it sure is a fun experience. I would definately recommend this game to anyone who likes FPS games, especially people who play CS:GO. The game takes a while to get used to but once you do, you will find yourself playing this game for days. I havn't played this game too much, so theres probably a lot I'm missing.

The minute I played zombies, I hardly touched multiplayer ever again. Than I found out about custom zombies. A year later I got a PC, started playing custom zombie maps. Still playing to this day. The best part is, the custom maps get better every year. Maps start to have more features. More weapons. Weapons even from later COD Installments.  There are custom maps that have gun like the Scar from MW2, the Thundergun from Black Ops, The Scavnger explosive sniper from Black Ops DLC Call of the Dead.  Tbh I can type all day about this game!

"Call of Duty: World at War, I have had it on PS3 for a substantially long amount of time. To be honest, this is phenomenal. I bought the game on Steam for the modding experience though, if you think that's what COD:WAW only has to offer, you're mistaken.  The campaign is a nice callback to the early days of COD (which was focused on the World Wars). There's cooperative gameplay, which I rarely ever see in COD's campaign mode. The story is very straightforward though, but it is very well-written, and executed beautifully.   The multiplayer is very good, but only play on servers you trust, there are many hackers on unprotected servers. There is Punkbuster, but it doesn't work anymore, though there is a way, and it requires a good bit of fiddling around for it to work.   Now, what most people wanted to hear, Zombies. In COD:WAW, (which started Zombies, by the way) there are four maps, which were once DLC. Modding Zombies just brings the experience to a whole new level. You can use many different weapons from the series by way of modding. To be honest, modding is the best thing that happened to COD:WAW.  Simply, I would recommend this game, but for a fun time, invite your friends for a round of Custom Zombies. Make sure of it.",1,call duty world war ps substantially long amount time honest phenomenal bought game steam modding experience though think thats codwaw offer youre mistaken campaign nice callback early days cod focused world wars theres cooperative gameplay rarely ever see cods campaign mode story straightforward though wellwritten executed beautifully multiplayer good play servers trust many hackers unprotected servers punkbuster doesnt work anymore though way requires good bit fiddling around work people wanted hear zombies codwaw started zombies way four maps dlc modding zombies brings experience whole new level use many different weapons series way modding honest modding best thing happened codwaw simply would recommend game fun time invite friends round custom zombies make sure

Along the starts of the pacfic the major focus on the eastern front on the advance of the soviet red army into nazi germany , including battles such as the battle of stalingrad ,seige of berlin. However the main focus on private reznov on his story upon the leading events in call of duty black ops .

"Its old but it is still alive with more than 2000 active players at any hour of the day, I decided to buy it again during the sales, I dont regret of getting it.  The game has a really inmersive single player campaign, with realistic environments and weaponry. You can also play Nazi Zombies gamemode, playing it alone is a bit boring and also, its very hard to get to high rounds, its a gamemode where you have to play with friends (up to 4). The maps of this title are the best ones I have seen, in my opinion they are better than Black Ops Saga ones, this ones arent that much of a cluster of ideas, upgrades, rays and lasers.  Multiplayer is fantastic, you can find maps of all sizes, small ones are not fun if there the server has many players, but the medium and large maps are quite enjoyable with big playerbases. Another interesting feature from WaW is that the big maps have tanks (T34 and Panzer IV), as far as I know, no other CoD has controllable land vehicles. Weaponry is well balanced in comparison to newer CoD titles. If you have to choose what to play, I recommend extreme mode, it feels the most accurate in this title since most weapons kill in 1-3 shots and you dont have the help of the crosshair or the map.",1,old still alive active players hour day decided buy sales dont regret getting game really inmersive single player campaign realistic environments weaponry also play nazi zombies gamemode playing alone bit boring also hard get high rounds gamemode play friends maps title best ones seen opinion better black ops saga ones ones arent much cluster ideas upgrades rays lasers multiplayer fantastic find maps sizes small ones fun server many players medium large maps quite enjoyable big playerbases another interesting feature waw big maps tanks panzer iv far know cod controllable land vehicles weaponry well balanced comparison newer cod titles choose play recommend extreme mode feels accurate title since weapons kill shots dont help crosshair map

"There's been a lot said about this game already, so...I'll say some more anyway, both about this entry and about the entire series.  Counter-Strike was created as a modification for  Half-Life  and quickly took on a life of its own, eventually meriting a standalone release by Valve. Its development process more or less invented the concept of the public beta. At one point around its public release, Internet traffic for the original surpassed the entire traffic output of Italy. The game itself across all its iterations can be described as easy to learn yet hard to master, like so many good games. Unlike chess and  go  however, CS primarily revolves around shooting people.  On the surface, it's simple. Counter-terrorists must stop terrorists from planting a bomb at a strategic location, or rescue hostages that the terrorists are holding. There's a handful of other modes included with the original, but they're almost never played. Players earn money over each round (more for winning and killing) to purchase more suitable guns and equipment.  In practice, rounds can sometimes end with one team being killed before any objectives can be seen to. Apart from a couple of series quirks that people have learned to love - or exploit, if they're Actual Pro Gamers(tm) - CS is pretty realistic. One shot, one kill and all of that. (No real story either, either explicit or in subtext.)   One thing CS has going for it that I haven't seen mentioned much is that you can play in bite-sized chunks if you want to. As far as I know, the reasons for it not being mentioned much are that the latest game ( Global Offensive ) has a competitive mode that encourages playing for entire matches, and that more dedicated players will often play for hours. Strictly speaking, I recommend playing in chunks: CS can get tense and difficult depending on your skill and the skill of your opposition.  However, the pacing is such that it's not exactly the hyperactive bulletfest most of today's shooters are: matches can end up as deadly games of cat and mouse as often as they erupt into firefights. Related is the fact that there is no prestige (apart from matchmaking rankings in Global Offensive) or killstreaks or what have you for players to literally level the playing field with. It can be frustrating to miss an opponent's head by a hair only for them to not miss in turn, or to be oneshotted out of the blue, but it's reassuring to know that skill is the primary factor here.  Another interesting thing is the individualism you usually see on display. Most players, especially Real Pro Gamers(tm), place a high emphasis on very skilled aiming, but a well-coordinated team that knows how to position themselves on a given map will generally have a big advantage against a team of lone wolf headshotters. CS doesn't exactly encourage team play or punish a lack of it like  Insurgency , but I will. (Encourage it, not punish the lack of it. (Much.))   This particular entry in the series still holds up; its aesthetic is more classic than dated, and you get the no-frills base gameplay that made the series what it is. If you're looking to get into the series I would still recommend  Source  or the cheaper, more modern (albeit probably more toxic) Global Offensive over this, but that's more a matter of preference and polish.  The main advantage this first entry has over the rest of its series is that you can play it on pretty much any computer these days, although Source is only a  little  more punishing on today's computers. There's a fair amount of mediocre (if somewhat classic) maps and no default bot support, but unlike the beautified expansion-slash-sequel  Condition Zero , you'll still find a lot of people in multiplayer; even more than in Source!  Please avoid Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies though. It may be based off this game, but it is bad.",1,theres lot said game already soill say anyway entry entire series counterstrike created modification halflife quickly took life eventually meriting standalone release valve development process less invented concept public beta one point around public release internet traffic original surpassed entire traffic output italy game across iterations described easy learn yet hard master like many good games unlike chess go however cs primarily revolves around shooting people surface simple counterterrorists must stop terrorists planting bomb strategic location rescue hostages terrorists holding theres handful modes included original theyre almost never played players earn money round winning killing purchase suitable guns equipment practice rounds sometimes end one team killed objectives seen apart couple series quirks people learned love exploit theyre actual pro gamerstm cs pretty realistic one shot one kill real story either either explicit subtext one thing cs going havent seen mentioned much play bitesized chunks want far know reasons mentioned much latest game global offensive competitive mode encourages playing entire matches dedicated players often play hours strictly speaking recommend playing chunks cs get tense difficult depending skill skill opposition however pacing exactly hyperactive bulletfest todays shooters matches end deadly games cat mouse often erupt firefights related fact prestige apart matchmaking rankings global offensive killstreaks players literally level playing field frustrating miss opponents head hair miss turn oneshotted blue reassuring know skill primary factor another interesting thing individualism usually see display players especially real pro gamerstm place high emphasis skilled aiming wellcoordinated team knows position given map generally big advantage team lone wolf headshotters cs doesnt exactly encourage team play punish lack like insurgency encourage punish lack much particular entry series still holds aesthetic classic dated get nofrills base gameplay made series youre looking get series would still recommend source cheaper modern albeit probably toxic global offensive thats matter preference polish main advantage first entry rest series play pretty much computer days although source little punishing todays computers theres fair amount mediocre somewhat classic maps default bot support unlike beautified expansionslashsequel condition zero youll still find lot people multiplayer even source please avoid counterstrike nexon zombies though may based game bad

"Call of Duty: World at War is a great game and I would highly recommend it! The campaign is fun and comes with a great storyline where you can see WW2 through the eyes of the Americans in Japanese islands and the Russians in Germany. There are a variety of historical weapons, tanks and places. The multiplayer has many servers. The servers include features such as customisable kits, acheivements, challenges and ranks. The only disadvantage is that sometimes in multiplayer, the game crashes for no reason. This doesn't happen very often but when it does, it is annoying. However this one disadvantage does not ruin the game and it is still very good and well worth the money!",1,call duty world war great game would highly recommend campaign fun comes great storyline see ww eyes americans japanese islands russians germany variety historical weapons tanks places multiplayer many servers servers include features customisable kits acheivements challenges ranks disadvantage sometimes multiplayer game crashes reason doesnt happen often annoying however one disadvantage ruin game still good well worth money

Multiplayer you play as any contry doing an objective like kill enemies, capture flags, and defuse bombs. Also in multiplayer you can get killstreaks for killing an amount of enemies , and also get tanks.

"This is by far my favorite Call of Duty game. One of the things that stand out to me which is why I love this COD so much is it's not like the others. I feel this was when COD was in its prime, (along with MW1 and BO1). I love the whole WWII feel, the campaign is actually really good (in my opinion) when compared to other sh--ty campaigns. Another thing that I love about this is how in the multiplayer, all the maps are really fun, some of the maps have tanks you can drive in, and some other maps such as 'Sub Pens' are just a giant f--k fest! One last thing that I feel really kicked off this game to a good start is the whole Nazi Zombies. Till this day the Nazi Zombies is one of if not my faviorite aspect of the COD games. I remember when I first played COD:WAW for the first time after beating the campaign I was like, 'Aww that sucks it's over.' But then the cutscene for the Nazi Zombies came on for Nacht Der Untoten and I was freaking out. I remember being so scared because I never knew this was a thing. But now I love the whole zombies 'Gamemode' so much. Especially on the computer since you can mod it so much on WAW and have so many fun and goofy maps, weapons, models, and ext.

"10/10 Great game, a few problems such as sometimes LAN games and other co-op functions not working, but the campaign is amazing, zombies is addicting, multiplayer is fun...  This game has online/LAN co-op for the campaign and zombies, and of course multiplayer/simgleplayer  Great story line on the campaign, and its an older game, so dont get disapointed over low quality graphics/physics, remember gamplay &gt; graphics  From 420 blazing a line of angry advancing japaneses banzai troopers with the flamethrower, to ruthelessly sniping nazis, to sacrificing for the motherland, the campaign is a rock solid story.  Getting mauled at round 6 of zombies cause you got stuck on a couch, or surviving to round 26 cause you got the ppsh-41, zombies is addicting and it takes a while before it gets boring. And, if you can work console commands and custom maps, zombies never gets old  Going on a ruthless killing spree with the ppsh-41 drum mags, or getting dominated by steady aim mp-40s, its always fun...  And remember this was before Call of Duty became Call of S***, so buy and it and enjoy it!",1,great game problems sometimes lan games coop functions working campaign amazing zombies addicting multiplayer fun game onlinelan coop campaign zombies course multiplayersimgleplayer great story line campaign older game dont get disapointed low quality graphicsphysics remember gamplay gt graphics blazing line angry advancing japaneses banzai troopers flamethrower ruthelessly sniping nazis sacrificing motherland campaign rock solid story getting mauled round zombies cause got stuck couch surviving round cause got ppsh zombies addicting takes gets boring work console commands custom maps zombies never gets old going ruthless killing spree ppsh drum mags getting dominated steady aim mps always fun remember call duty became call buy enjoy

Big Red One was mediocre. Finest Hour was mediocre. NDS versions are mediocre. World at War is a great game. But how much can you improve over WWII? You can't lie on history.

"After 45+ hours of playing I think its time to give it a review. NOTE: I didn't try Multiplayer or Campaign. So this review is entirely based on zombies. Pros- You get All of the DLC's with the game.  The custom zombies community is amazing and there is always fresh content to try, some maps even equal Treyarch zombie maps or might even be better than some Treyarch maps. Mods are super easy to download and install. Your PC can be horrible and you can still run this game. Decently Optimised. Cons- Servers are still there if your prepared to wait, however sometimes it feels like your the only one looking to play a game of zombies.  Thats about it, I highly recommend this game for zombies alone. I would even recommend at 40 euro since the custom zombies community is constantly pumping out new content and I have 45 hours into this game and I only played like 4 maps, even though I downloaded more. Hundreds of hours worth of zombie maps online. Well worth the purchase.",1,hours playing think time give review note didnt try multiplayer campaign review entirely based zombies pros get dlcs game custom zombies community amazing always fresh content try maps even equal treyarch zombie maps might even better treyarch maps mods super easy download install pc horrible still run game decently optimised cons servers still prepared wait however sometimes feels like one looking play game zombies thats highly recommend game zombies alone would even recommend euro since custom zombies community constantly pumping new content hours game played like maps even though downloaded hundreds hours worth zombie maps online well worth purchase

Call of Duty World at War is the epicest CoD of all the other titles in the series.   The Singleplayer campaign is really epic and very intense (especially the Stalingrad mission) and also with some pretty herioc... and of course great moments. Furthermore the multiplayer mode is not bad and sometimes really funny like for example 'the dog kill streak' and many other crazy stuff. Last but not least... that the multiplayer mode is kinda a mix of CoD4 Modern Warfare and CoD2. But the basics are still the same like in other titles made by Infinity Ward/Treyarch.,1,call duty world war epicest cod titles series singleplayer campaign really epic intense especially stalingrad mission also pretty herioc course great moments furthermore multiplayer mode bad sometimes really funny like example dog kill streak many crazy stuff last least multiplayer mode kinda mix cod modern warfare cod basics still like titles made infinity wardtreyarch

Trump owns a large chain of convenience stores, or that he is an international terrorist threat. At this point I'm not entirely sure which it is.

"Counter-Strike: Source, Counter-Strike: Condition Zero and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive are great games but let's not forget about the original one, the one that made them, that without it, they probably wouldn't exist or would be different, this, this game is a gem I tell you. Now, you'll ask, why play this game when we have Source and Global Offensive? The answer is simple, either for nostalgia or to see how great this game was back in the time and where it all started, of course, the game version is 1.6 so it is not the oldest version but it does not matters, there could be many reasons to play this game, It got maps that aren't on Source and/or Global Offensive, It has a riot shield (even if I'm not too fan of this tactical item in Multiplayer games) and a different gameplay than CS:GO and Source, If you think Source is hard because of the recoil, of course, it's pretty similar to Source but it's a little different (or maybe It is just me) but anyway, you will get used to it quick, It's not like it was Arma... or real life.  I would suggest it to any Counter-Strike, semi-tactical, counter terrorists and FPS fans (except for those who are COD hardcore fanboys but who knows, you may change and prefer Counter-Strike to COD).  And remember this. This isn't the killing house anymore, this is real life!  9.5/10",1,counterstrike source counterstrike condition zero counterstrike global offensive great games lets forget original one one made without probably wouldnt exist would different game gem tell youll ask play game source global offensive answer simple either nostalgia see great game back time started course game version oldest version matters could many reasons play game got maps arent source andor global offensive riot shield even im fan tactical item multiplayer games different gameplay csgo source think source hard recoil course pretty similar source little different maybe anyway get used quick like arma real life would suggest counterstrike semitactical counter terrorists fps fans except cod hardcore fanboys knows may change prefer counterstrike cod remember isnt killing house anymore real life

MULTIPLAYER: Now, this is actually my favorite part about this game, the multiplayer, wow where can i start? you start off with level 1, and work your way up to prestige 10! You can unlock new guns, play amazing maps (custom maps and others..) Theyarch back then actually cared about this franchise and made these amazing maps to play on, to being a fast guy with a thompson, to playing it safe as a couch sniper, you'll have hundreds of fun on this multiplayer! TRUST ME, I'm serious...  ZOMBIES: Wow.  I can't even explain zombies, damn.  Zombies is a 4 player CO-OP Killing expirence like no other, you play as 4 different characters with their own personality, zombies has a HUGE backstory to it, it's super insane. From teleporting to different areas in Dir REISE, To going in the swamps of shi no numa, you don't even have to play the regular maps! there is thousands of custom maps, this is by far one of the best CO-OP Zombie games i've played in my life of gaming. This will put you to hundreds of hours on this game, now i only got this game last week and i already have almost a day on the game.   OVERVIEW: Like you've hopefully Read, this is probably the best COD I've ever played in my life, it tops MW2, COD 4.. All the actual GOOD Ones.

One of the Best First Person Shooters Ever  the thing that makes this game so awesome is that you will always have competition and theres no excuse for losing or winning because the only thing that can make you good in it is experience there are no in-game purchases and its really hard to get pro or even decent as it doesnt have auto-recovery as many FPS nowdays Highly Recommended,1,one best first person shooters ever thing makes game awesome always competition theres excuse losing winning thing make good experience ingame purchases really hard get pro even decent doesnt autorecovery many fps nowdays highly recommended

"If you don't like Call of Duty: Zombies then stop reading this post right now and stop considering buying this game. You won't like it. I can't say much for multiplayer or campaign aspects of this game, but the zombies and modded zombies are truly extensive and amazing. I think the greatest thing about a lot of the custom zombies maps is that they have an end other than the death of the player(s). All in all it's a game well worth the buy, but if you don't have much money just wait for a sale (Steam has a lot of those... LOL). If you are a Call of Duty gun nerd then this is certainly a good pick because the maps have guns from every Call of Duty ever. From the good ol' not-so-classics like MW3 to the new games like AW and BO3, you name them, they're there. Also the maps have a number of themes from holiday's to movies, even original ideas. Easter eggs are a large part of the good maps nowadays, you'd be unlucky to find a good map without a zombies gun game mode too! Definitley recommend this game to anyone and everyone above the age of 12.",1,dont like call duty zombies stop reading post right stop considering buying game wont like cant say much multiplayer campaign aspects game zombies modded zombies truly extensive amazing think greatest thing lot custom zombies maps end death players game well worth buy dont much money wait sale steam lot lol call duty gun nerd certainly good pick maps guns every call duty ever good ol notsoclassics like mw new games like aw bo name theyre also maps number themes holidays movies even original ideas easter eggs large part good maps nowadays youd unlucky find good map without zombies gun game mode definitley recommend game anyone everyone age

"A great game of cat-and-mouse where you either play as a terrorist (plant bombs or hold hostages) or counter-terrorist (defend bombsites or rescue hostages). Either complete those objectives or kill all players of the opposing team to win the round.  Counter-Strike is a fast-paced, realistic shooter that encourages teamwork so play with a friend (it's also more fun). The graphics hasn't aged well but the guns still looks authentic. One thing I hate about Counter-Strike is when you die, you have to sit and wait until the round ends. Even if the rounds are usually short, it's frustrating and it puts a ton of anxiety to your efforts of staying alive. Fortunately, Counter-Strike has tons of mods available so you're able to play the game in many different ways. This helps the game from becoming monotonous and keep the game fresh.  There's also not a lot of detail in the sound, other than the guns, but that's a minor complaint. The mods, dedicated servers and competitive nature of the game is what holds this game together to this day and that's why millions of people still play this old-school game. Although there are many better shooters on the market now, Counter-Strike's unique gameplay is what keeps me coming back from time to time.  8/10 - GREAT GAME",1,great game catandmouse either play terrorist plant bombs hold hostages counterterrorist defend bombsites rescue hostages either complete objectives kill players opposing team win round counterstrike fastpaced realistic shooter encourages teamwork play friend also fun graphics hasnt aged well guns still looks authentic one thing hate counterstrike die sit wait round ends even rounds usually short frustrating puts ton anxiety efforts staying alive fortunately counterstrike tons mods available youre able play game many different ways helps game becoming monotonous keep game fresh theres also lot detail sound guns thats minor complaint mods dedicated servers competitive nature game holds game together day thats millions people still play oldschool game although many better shooters market counterstrikes unique gameplay keeps coming back time time great game

Vs the MW2 Servers being shut down. This is a game to get, even after nearly 7 years of it being released. The gameplay is amazing.  I mean I think it supports up to 1 million troops.

On the other note, if you keep on pressing like the XXX and the YYY and the XXX and the YYY again, you will be sucked. - Tak Fuji, E3  It does take some teamwork on nazi zombies, especially custom maps, which I love that are updated and include new perks and weapons made by the impressing modding community itself.

I mean, come on. Can't people try making normal servers for those of us who don't want to play in 32 versus 32 matches????  Sum it up, get it for the campaign and zombies.

However, you won't find many servers that use the regular maps anymore, so plan to do it with friend you know before you buy this game.

"1. Buy the best CoD!  It's well programmed and with a good netcode for competentiv multiplayer matches.  2. Install and do the following tweaks if you want (These are not cheats or other unauthorized interventions): Two options to do this: either with the ingame console - the fast way to see the results after you enter the command - or by editing your mp_config.cfg (you can find the path to the file at the end) Before you can use the console (^ button), you have to enable it in the gamesettings. An advanced console you can call if you press shif and ^.  I would suggest to try the multiplayer first without the tweaks. so you can see the difference/improvements.  /cg_fov 65 – 80 (set the Field of View between 65 by default and 80) /cg_drawfps 0 - 1 (FPS-Counter, 0 = off, 1 = on) /cg_drawlagometer 0 - 1 (display network latency, 0 = off, 1 on) /com_maxfps 0 – 999 (set the max. fps the game respectively your pc can reach, by default: 90.   some server could kick you if you set this value to high. If you have a 60Hz+ Monitor it's recommended to set the value to the Refreshrate of your monitor to provide a smooth expirence) /cl_maxpackets 30 – 100 (set it to 100, it will improve your ping. if not set it back to default at 30) /cl_packetdup 0 – 5 (depends on ping, higher ping -&gt; higher Value is better. see below) The following information should be regarded as guidelines: /cl_packetdup 0 -&gt; LAN 1-20ms /cl_packetdup 1 -&gt; ping 20-40ms /cl_packetdup 2 -&gt; ping 40-60ms /cl_packetdup 3 -&gt; ping 60-80ms /cl_packetdup 4 -&gt; ping 80-100ms /cl_packetdup 5 -&gt; ping 100ms or higher  3.

"Counter-Strike...  This game is the reason to why I got a Steam account in the first place. I got this game six years ago from a near friend of mine. Everytime I was at his place we used to play this together in turns; he played for a while, maybe 2-3 deaths then I played. We had such a great time. But... the problem was that outside his house we couldn't play the game together.   At the time my dad didn't allow me to buy the game, so my friend ended up giving it to me as a christmas present. Since that day we played it all the time. One of our favorite servers was Eropid (HS Only). He (my friend) ended up beeing in 4-5 place for a while on the server.   Overall, I've had a great time playing this game, and still enjoy playing it today. The game was the start to my FPS gaming interest and since then I've bought every CS released.  I recommed this game to anyone who wants to start play FPS games; as it is a great starting game. I also recommend that you play it with your friends; that way you will get the most fun out of it!   Thanks for reading, and enjoy!   - nité  ",1,counterstrike game reason got steam account first place got game six years ago near friend mine everytime place used play together turns played maybe deaths played great time problem outside house couldnt play game together time dad didnt allow buy game friend ended giving christmas present since day played time one favorite servers eropid hs friend ended beeing place server overall ive great time playing game still enjoy playing today game start fps gaming interest since ive bought every cs released recommed game anyone wants start play fps games great starting game also recommend play friends way get fun thanks reading enjoy nit

It's an authentic World War II shooter with plenty of weapons of the era to choose from. The story (which can be played in co-op) and characters are for the most part very good despite being significantly short, and the gameplay is frantic and exciting. The multiplayer is amazing in pretty much every sense, with an unconventional design for  Call of Duty 's standards. This was the one in the series that started zombies as well, and while  Nacht Der Untoten  isn't a highlight of the game mode it is raw and hardcore, and  Der Riese  is outstanding especially with friends. Filled with mysteries. The mode also gave birth to the marvelous soundtrack provided by  Kevin Sherwood  &amp;  Elena Siegman.

"This game is pretty   avarage  .     Campaign is completely uninteresting, mediocre, avarage. Multiplayer is terribly balanced (otherwise it would be OK).  Singleplayer is as shallow and bland as it could ever be. There's literally no story, it's just a set of random missions that were selected from WWII history. It crashes every two hours of playtime. There's literally no player interaction in co-op, except for reviving. Characters are uninteresting. The only advantage of this game is the COD engine - thanks to which, the game plays smoothly and movement is very responsive.  Multiplayer is slowly dying, you'll only find a few servers that are left running. Most of them are meat grinders (remember 24/7 Operation Metro TDM in Battlefield 3?). The balance is completly terrible - there's no nuke killstreak, because submashine guns pretty much do the same thing. Tanks look good on paper, but in reality one of the factions always conquers all the tanks at the beginning of game, thus the other team already lost the game, because they're facing a squad of almost-indestructible camping tanks.  Customisation is almost non-existant, you just choose your guns and two perks.  Don't get me wrong - the game is NOT a disaster, it's not the worst experience ever. But it isn't anything great either and it could have been better with more effort put into right things. Also I don't find it worth of the money - even though the game is old, you won't find the steam version for less than 10€.",-1,game pretty avarage campaign completely uninteresting mediocre avarage multiplayer terribly balanced otherwise would ok singleplayer shallow bland could ever theres literally story set random missions selected wwii history crashes every two hours playtime theres literally player interaction coop except reviving characters uninteresting advantage game cod engine thanks game plays smoothly movement responsive multiplayer slowly dying youll find servers left running meat grinders remember operation metro tdm battlefield balance completly terrible theres nuke killstreak submashine guns pretty much thing tanks look good paper reality one factions always conquers tanks beginning game thus team already lost game theyre facing squad almostindestructible camping tanks customisation almost nonexistant choose guns two perks dont get wrong game disaster worst experience ever isnt anything great either could better effort put right things also dont find worth money even though game old wont find steam version less

"At a first glimpse one might think it's one of those repetitive WWII shooters with same cliche-filled story to play through. But unlike the recent post-world war games, this one actually stands out with its refined gameplay, innovative story and decent graphics.   The only drawback with the game is its short singelplayer campaign, finishing it around 5-6 hours is not impossible which is unfortunate since the campaign picks up the pace just at the end. Nevertheless, it's worth to pick up for a small price if you're into WWII games - best around since CoD II!   4 out of 5 tiger-tanks.",1,first glimpse one might think one repetitive wwii shooters clichefilled story play unlike recent postworld war games one actually stands refined gameplay innovative story decent graphics drawback game short singelplayer campaign finishing around hours impossible unfortunate since campaign picks pace end nevertheless worth pick small price youre wwii games best around since cod ii tigertanks

"Playing this f#cking game made me notice how much I miss the old WW2 FPS games, instead of the new futuristic crap wars that this franchise keeps making up to keep milking blind fans. The thing is, every time I tried to finish this game something happens and I couldn't finish it. Well, until now, that is. Is this game worth it or not? As usual, I'm gonna explain the bad things it has first, although being honest there's not much wrong with it.  First and foremost, the story is split in two different parts of WW2, the Americans trying to get revenge after the Pearl Harbor mess and Russia kicking some nazi ♥♥♥. And personally, the American part of the game needed some work. The characters are just SO DAMN BLAND, EVEN FOR COD STANDARDS. And it even tries to pull the   'suddenly killing an important character infront of you and you can't do anything about it' multiple times, and it fails to get anything because neither I know ANYTHING about those character, neither I even CARE about them.   It just means I'll have a different American dumb#ss yelling at me every 10 seconds.  Going further with the American side of the story, while they offer some nice changes from the rest of the series, they repeat itself a bit too much. Seriously, most of the American part of the game is spent crawling in trenches and holes in the ground. One of it's missions has one of the moments I most liked on the game, the whole level on the plane using all of those cool guns and it just makes me wonder WHY AREN'T THERE MORE OF THOSE AND LESS DAMN HOLES IN THE GROUND.  Also, the game is kinda short. Now sure, CoD games always have a short story mode but hell, in Modern Warfare titles they make up a dumb story behind all of the pew pew pew democracy MURRICA, here they didn't really need to think of a story as it wrote itself years ago. It lasts around 4 to 5 hours, but will take you more on high difficulties. It ends with a good taste, but it's a bit needlessly short to my refined-afro-fueled taste.  Lastly, it has some gameplay issues, similar to what you would expect from the rest of this damn ♥♥♥♥♥d franchise. Corpses freezing in mid-air, enemies doing nothing but spamming grenades on high difficulties, enemies respawining non-stop and even respawning in between your allies in insane places, that sort of stuff. Seriously, don't even bother to use normal grenades in anything that isn't normal or easy difficulty, most times enemies will just pick them up and throw them back at your face. Thank motherf#cking mother Russia the Soviet story has molotovs.  All of that being said, what does the game have to offer? Well, if you're played games such as the three original CoD's or Medal of Honor (before it went Modern Warfare Ripoff mode) then you'll know what to expect.  The story, while being a bit bland on the American side, is quite engaging and fun to go through. Specially the Russian side of it, which feels like it was done by completely different people, as...  ...Well, the Russian side it's just SO F#CKING GOOD. AMAZING MUSIC, AMAZING LEVELS, AMAZING CHARACTERS AND ACTION, JUST WHY COULDN'T THE GAME BE ALL WITH THEM!? I'M NOT JOKING.  Weapons are also great. You know this sh#t feeling you get in pretty much all CoD games that any weapon which isn't a Sniper Rifle or an Assault weapon is trash? Well, while Shotguns still seem to be irrelevant on this game, you'll be surprised to find that pretty much all weapons are useful. I actually do suggest switching and trying them all to find what suits your style more. Also, the American vs Japan and Russia vs Nazis stories have different weapons completely, which is a good effort.  Something that also surprised me were the vehicle sections. Both stories have a level in which you're in somewhat control of a vehicle, the Americans being the multiple turrets of a big-#ss plane and the Russians being a damn vodka-fueled tank of atomic destruction. Both of them were actually quite fun, specially the plane one.  The game also has Coop, although I couldn't try it out this time. I bet it's fun, but I wanted to try it out by myself anyway. The Coop that I did try is the Nazi Zombies mode a long time ago on the Xbox360 of a friend, and that sh#t is fun as hell.  Is the game worth it, then? Well, the problem is mainly the price. For 20€ I don't think it is. For that price, either wait for a sale that drops it to 5€ or lower, or just buy it on console, however I DO recommend playing it. It's fun, and a good throwback to the classic CoD's.  TL;DR Edition: Think of Modern Warfare 1 but with Vietnam flashes and the Soviet Union suplexing Nazis. It's fun as hell, specially the Coop with the Nazi Zombies unlockable mode, but 20€ is a bit way too much.",1,playing fcking game made notice much miss old ww fps games instead new futuristic crap wars franchise keeps making keep milking blind fans thing every time tried finish game something happens couldnt finish well game worth usual im gonna explain bad things first although honest theres much wrong first foremost story split two different parts ww americans trying get revenge pearl harbor mess russia kicking nazi personally american part game needed work characters damn bland even cod standards even tries pull suddenly killing important character infront cant anything multiple times fails get anything neither know anything character neither even care means ill different american dumbss yelling every seconds going american side story offer nice changes rest series repeat bit much seriously american part game spent crawling trenches holes ground one missions one moments liked game whole level plane using cool guns makes wonder arent less damn holes ground also game kinda short sure cod games always short story mode hell modern warfare titles make dumb story behind pew pew pew democracy murrica didnt really need think story wrote years ago lasts around hours take high difficulties ends good taste bit needlessly short refinedafrofueled taste lastly gameplay issues similar would expect rest damn franchise corpses freezing midair enemies nothing spamming grenades high difficulties enemies respawining nonstop even respawning allies insane places sort stuff seriously dont even bother use normal grenades anything isnt normal easy difficulty times enemies pick throw back face thank motherfcking mother russia soviet story molotovs said game offer well youre played games three original cods medal honor went modern warfare ripoff mode youll know expect story bit bland american side quite engaging fun go specially russian side feels like done completely different people well russian side fcking good amazing music amazing levels amazing characters action couldnt game im joking weapons also great know sht feeling get pretty much cod games weapon isnt sniper rifle assault weapon trash well shotguns still seem irrelevant game youll surprised find pretty much weapons useful actually suggest switching trying find suits style also american vs japan russia vs nazis stories different weapons completely good effort something also surprised vehicle sections stories level youre somewhat control vehicle americans multiple turrets bigss plane russians damn vodkafueled tank atomic destruction actually quite fun specially plane one game also coop although couldnt try time bet fun wanted try anyway coop try nazi zombies mode long time ago xbox friend sht fun hell game worth well problem mainly price dont think price either wait sale drops lower buy console however recommend playing fun good throwback classic cods tldr edition think modern warfare vietnam flashes soviet union suplexing nazis fun hell specially coop nazi zombies unlockable mode bit way much

"Dog shooter simulator.       Joke aside, this game is either take it or leave it, to be honest. It's the dullest and least fluid Call Of Duty compared to the previous ones (don't count parts after this one) regarding the gameplay. Despite all the patches there are movement bugs where even squashed soda-can can interrupt your movement. Sometimes I can't even climb up the stairs in bunkers. Maps are designed in such a manner that when you start playing it for the very first few times every fence top may seem like an enemy's head. You start shooting, and blow up your cover. Prestige mode allows you to unlock 5 additional class slots (default number is 5), but you have to play for an eternity to achieve that, 'cause you have to reach level 65 in every prestige level, and reset the game starting playing all over again without top-tier perks and weapons. Tanks are back, and that's something that Call Of Duty 2 has lacked. Unfortunately there are not much active multiplayer servers without mods. Playing multiplayer in normal setting is awful, 'cause you need entire truck to supply you with ammunition in order to kill just one person. Play it in hardcore servers only, it's more realistic. Ha, and I dislike that multiplayer protection which made me buy this game. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) But still I play it on the cracked version with the original code. Butt-hurt much?  There are so many good and bad sides of this COD part, so I'll just recommend it, but without much enthusiasm. It's the last good Call Of Duty game actually. Also it's a game from my teenage days.

"Call of Duty: World at War Review  After the success of Call of Duty Modern Warfare; which brought the whole first person shooter genre into modern day settings, infinity ward was slated to make a sequel. In the meantime, Treyarch was tasked to fill in for a year. How does one go about following up to Modern Warfare, arguably one of the best in the series? They didn’t go modern or push forward in time to the future, but instead went back in time once more to revisit World War Two. At first it would appear to be a huge step back, however it was the opposite. Treyarch made the right decision not to follow the same path as previous WWII entries by having the American campaign set during the invasion of Normandy. I mean how many times can you storm Omaha, seriously?! Instead the American campaign see’s the player fight in the battles of Peleliu and Okinawa on the Japanese front. The character is again a silent private who just takes orders without question, and is led by sergeant Roebuck who is voiced by none other than Jack Bauer himself: Keifer Sutherland. Running off of the same engine as Modern Warfare, the graphics still look crisp and new. If you have a decent rig you can turn off v-sync and run the game at 90 frames-per-second.  The American’s aren’t the only ones you play as, the total badass Russians also have a campaign starting in Stalingrad, and ending in Berlin with the taking of the Reichstag. The campaign jumps from the American to Russian campaign with great frequency to mix up the setting. The Russian campaign culminates in some epic moments which might not have felt the same if it hadn’t started with the battle of Stalingrad, even though at first the battle of Stalingrad may not seem original. Starting in Stalingrad the player experiences the struggle to regain the motherland from the clutches of Germany and then takes the fight to them. The final level of the game gives the player some of the best Call of Duty blockbuster moments, where you are just awash with the waters of victory coursing through you. In other words, you do some very cool things which I will not mention for the sake of avoiding spoilers. Yes again the Russian character is a generic silent private led by a Sergeant Reznov, who is your typical portrayal of a Russian Commander-in-chief.  The gun play and cover system is rock solid as usual, giving the player some nice snappy shooting with the ability to peek out of cover around corners. You can cook grenades and toss enemy grenades back at them. World at War pretty much follows all the common tropes of a cinematic Call of Duty game. The campaign can be played solo or co-op. World at War was really important because it introduced the now iconic solo/co-op game mode: Nazi Zombies. This was probably the biggest advancement to the Call of Duty series at the time. Nazi Zombies provides the player with extra hours of fun on a few different maps. The point of Nazi Zombies is to see how many waves of vile Nazi Zombies you can survive. This is definitely a game mode that you’ll get more out of with some friends. You start off with a pistol and some money which can be used to unlock weapons. The weapons are purchased by going up to the outlines of guns hanging on the walls and pressing the action button to acquire them. You can go back to previously purchased guns to obtain ammo by using the in game money of course. Now there’s the matter of obtaining money. Around the map you will find boarded up windows and doors with slits to shoot through. When a zombie reaches one of these barriers it will begin to remove it board by board and once all the boards are removed will enter the player’s “safe zone”. You can replace the boards by going up to the opening and holding down the action button. Rebuilding barriers nets the player some cash, two hundred dollars a board to be precise. To successfully survive, be sure to constantly rebuild the barriers and remain calm and patient, scoring headshots on the nasty’s. I believe every Treyarch Call of Duty following this one included Nazi Zombies mode, that’s how successful it was. In addition to the stellar campaign and the frightfully fun Nazi Zombies is of course your standard fiesta of multiplayer modes. The game also has an emotional and tonally correct soundtrack, fusing an orchestra and choir with some electronic and metal sounds. Written by Sean Murray, it packs a real punch and lifts the whole single player experience even higher. My personal favourites all come from the Russian campaign.   Ultimately this was an exceptional and important entry in the series. The thing that impressed me the most about Call of Duty: World at War was the fact that they had the conviction to go back to WWII after Call of Duty 4. They went back and they made one the best and most influential entries in the series next to 4. Some may say the original or Call of Duty 4 is the best, but my personal favourite is Call of Duty: Black Ops.  8.5/10",1,call duty world war review success call duty modern warfare brought whole first person shooter genre modern day settings infinity ward slated make sequel meantime treyarch tasked fill year one go following modern warfare arguably one best series didnt go modern push forward time future instead went back time revisit world war two first would appear huge step back however opposite treyarch made right decision follow path previous wwii entries american campaign set invasion normandy mean many times storm omaha seriously instead american campaign sees player fight battles peleliu okinawa japanese front character silent private takes orders without question led sergeant roebuck voiced none jack bauer keifer sutherland running engine modern warfare graphics still look crisp new decent rig turn vsync run game framespersecond americans arent ones play total badass russians also campaign starting stalingrad ending berlin taking reichstag campaign jumps american russian campaign great frequency mix setting russian campaign culminates epic moments might felt hadnt started battle stalingrad even though first battle stalingrad may seem original starting stalingrad player experiences struggle regain motherland clutches germany takes fight final level game gives player best call duty blockbuster moments awash waters victory coursing words cool things mention sake avoiding spoilers yes russian character generic silent private led sergeant reznov typical portrayal russian commanderinchief gun play cover system rock solid usual giving player nice snappy shooting ability peek cover around corners cook grenades toss enemy grenades back world war pretty much follows common tropes cinematic call duty game campaign played solo coop world war really important introduced iconic solocoop game mode nazi zombies probably biggest advancement call duty series time nazi zombies provides player extra hours fun different maps point nazi zombies see many waves vile nazi zombies survive definitely game mode youll get friends start pistol money used unlock weapons weapons purchased going outlines guns hanging walls pressing action button acquire go back previously purchased guns obtain ammo using game money course theres matter obtaining money around map find boarded windows doors slits shoot zombie reaches one barriers begin remove board board boards removed enter players safe zone replace boards going opening holding action button rebuilding barriers nets player cash two hundred dollars board precise successfully survive sure constantly rebuild barriers remain calm patient scoring headshots nastys believe every treyarch call duty following one included nazi zombies mode thats successful addition stellar campaign frightfully fun nazi zombies course standard fiesta multiplayer modes game also emotional tonally correct soundtrack fusing orchestra choir electronic metal sounds written sean murray packs real punch lifts whole single player experience even higher personal favourites come russian campaign ultimately exceptional important entry series thing impressed call duty world war fact conviction go back wwii call duty went back made one best influential entries series next may say original call duty best personal favourite call duty black ops

"Counter-Strike - a series of computer games in the genre of team first-person shooter based on the engine GoldSource, originally appeared as a modification of Half-Life games.  You have to compare, so this game I will compare with СS: Source and CS: Global Offensive    Pros:    1. Battle PVP.   The multiplayer game is fully revealed the potential of the idea of the game. The most interesting part of this is. Under the bot can already tune in, but not in the real players. They can deceive, to negotiate, to use cunning tactics to create unusual ambushes.   2. The atmosphere and realism.   In all games, Valve is always a great atmosphere and I was impressed. It is evident that the developers have tried to do everything in this game, as in real life. For example, the sounds. Unfortunately, Valve released a patch in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive with new sounds and they made a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.       Minuses:    1. Cheaters.   Well, as without these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s? These sons of dogs prevent us from playing. Creators of cheats have always been one step ahead of the creators of the VAC anti-cheat. Valve is trying to improve its anti-cheat and have it turns out.I say that Valve do nothing, not worth it.   2.Graphic arts.   She was good at Counter-Strike as long as did not come out Source. I'm not picky about graphics, but after 30 minutes I start to hurt your eyes. Yes, and in general, this game proved to all that the graphics in games are not the most important thing.   3.Termination of support.   All good things always come to an end, and Counter-Strike is not an exception. The game goes more and more players, server empty.More Valve does not release an update for Counter-Strike and does not support it in e-sports.     Conclusion:     Despite the fact that in this game there are downsides, even if they have, but still this game is legendary.  If you ask me, as you Counter-Strike, the fond memories flooding back me, maybe I can cry .Game, which was able to give me a lot of positive emotions..

"This is an interesting game. It is incredibly difficult to rate it either 'yes' or 'no.' There are far too many points to consider. Counter-Strike was released nearly fourteen years ago, yet it is still difficult to find an open server. It is incredibly fun and can make you laugh or tear your hair out. This game can be excellent for fans of strategy games and shooters, but it's very rare to be able to enjoy it fully. Unless you play on competitive servers, most everyone goes 'rogue' and does not work as a team. There are frequent cheaters using programs to increase movement speed, look through walls, or assist in aiming. If you look through the community page, many of the posts are pictures of cats or pornography. When joining a new game, you always feel paranoid about what the server is downloading. The community can be very scary; you must play on servers you trust with people you respect. If you can do this, you will have a blast. Counter-Strike is still played by a huge number of people; you can find great servers with great communities in nearly every language imaginable. There's a wide variety of weapons to choose from, and it is simple to get in on the action. There are no pay-to-win or customization features—only action. Counter-Strike can be a fantastic game if you know how to use it properly.  Things to note: • There are no bots in CS. However, the Counter-Strike: Condition Zero package (probably the best way to purchase the game) includes Condition Zero, which has support for bots and can be played without an Internet connection. • This is not 1.6 (to my knowledge); there are no shields and a few things are different (the difference is negligible). However, Counter-Strike: Condition Zero still has these features. • This is considered a mod for Half-Life. However, it can be downloaded independently. Note that Counter-Strike will be saved inside the 'Half-Life' folder on your computer.",1,interesting game incredibly difficult rate either yes far many points consider counterstrike released nearly fourteen years ago yet still difficult find open server incredibly fun make laugh tear hair game excellent fans strategy games shooters rare able enjoy fully unless play competitive servers everyone goes rogue work team frequent cheaters using programs increase movement speed look walls assist aiming look community page many posts pictures cats pornography joining new game always feel paranoid server downloading community scary must play servers trust people respect blast counterstrike still played huge number people find great servers great communities nearly every language imaginable theres wide variety weapons choose simple get action paytowin customization featuresonly action counterstrike fantastic game know use properly things note bots cs however counterstrike condition zero package probably best way purchase game includes condition zero support bots played without internet connection knowledge shields things different difference negligible however counterstrike condition zero still features considered mod halflife however downloaded independently note counterstrike saved inside halflife folder computer

And during Beta Version 4 (B-V4) Valve became interested in the game that was being developed, hired the developers for valve to help make it better, and in a few years the original developers quit making the game and let Valve take control of it. If you like the classic First Person Shooters from around 1995-2002 this is basically the game for you. Also you can shoot through almost every wall with every gun in the game.

You play it over and over, finally getting your first kill. (cause the enemy was coruching and looking the other way and you instantly kill him running 17 bullets spent) you get high hopes, I can play this game it is so easy. You get more kills, you get greedy you rush alone you get killed when you even thought about rushing by an AWP on mid. Ages pass, poeple pass, kills get comon.

You play DM and DM only with an awp, your kills are slick, and your flicks are quick and accurate. Admin invites you to his clan. FIrst time you play this game with somenone for serious. You can't do anything cause you are not used to an opposite player to play smartly and you get owned, you don't do kills and your teammates question your skill. Couple more months pass you learn your duties as a teammate. You give info you cover you open. Clan gets closed down, you find another clan you are one of the best players. You play more switch clans for better ones. You get to LANs you get scared of the all expecations and so many eyes on you. You tilt and miss your shots, months pass, you get better, you become a man of steel and high nervous, 2000 hours pass you are finally a great player. 10 000 hours pass, you win LANs you play against better players, you try a gainst payed players you are toe-to-toe with them but you loose cause your team isn't on that level and they get scared. 20 000 hours pass game is dying and so is your love for this game. But no one can pay thoose voice chats from 8 P.M till 6 A.M every weekend with your friends. So much hours in this game and you acomplished nothing. You play against your local teams you get banned cause they don't expect somene to play that good without cheats and you stop playing this cause cheaters take over, very 12 year old first downloads a cheat then this game. You get mentally tortured cause the kid is telling you how bad you are and that you suck, you cry inside. Thinking what happened to me, how come this kid plays better then me, then you figure out the cheats are great, but you still play it fairly. You cry cause no one cares for e-sports in your country and no one wants to pay you for playing games. Your parents tell you you don't have a life you loose some friends, you loose your girlfriend you stop being active in sports. YOu just play this game hoping to be recognised, but you don't so to help everyone in this world after 30 000 hours on this game, don't play it it is a sinking ship and it is pulling you down.

"Despite having the completely unenviable job of following up CoD4, WaW manages to be pretty decent even if it does not quite match its predecessor's level of quality. Taking the series back to WW2, this game, rather than going to the classic and arguably overused setting of Western Europe (USA/Britain/Canada/etc vs Germany in 1944-45), you instead go to the Ostfront (Germany vs USSR) and the Pacific (USA vs Japan). One thing that is captured really well in this game is the dark and merciless nature of the fighting on these two fronts: you see executions of prisoners and unarmed soldiers trying to surrender (VERY common occurances on these two fronts committed by both sides), and a few times you are even asked to pull the trigger yourself. Ugly, but refreshing too since it ensures that this game isn't just another 'America ♥♥♥♥ Yeah WW2' game where its good vs evil, but a much more realistic and morally grey experience. The history nut in me liked this little detail enough that this alone would make me recommend this game, if only to get a glimpse of how vicious the war between the Americans and Japanese, and especially the Germans and Soviets, truly was.  Honestly though, it's a decent game for shooter fans too and not just crazies like me. Though this is also the game that introduced the Zombie mode to CoD, so that could be a potential turn-off for you. Still, you can have fun with this one.",1,despite completely unenviable job following cod waw manages pretty decent even quite match predecessors level quality taking series back ww game rather going classic arguably overused setting western europe usabritaincanadaetc vs germany instead go ostfront germany vs ussr pacific usa vs japan one thing captured really well game dark merciless nature fighting two fronts see executions prisoners unarmed soldiers trying surrender common occurances two fronts committed sides times even asked pull trigger ugly refreshing since ensures game isnt another america yeah ww game good vs evil much realistic morally grey experience history nut liked little detail enough alone would make recommend game get glimpse vicious war americans japanese especially germans soviets truly honestly though decent game shooter fans crazies like though also game introduced zombie mode cod could potential turnoff still fun one

"Ah Call of Duty, synonymous with 12 years olds and at least 2 years of our own pent up rage, this isn't going to be an entirely hate driven review, more to the point and not a review of the community that plays it.  W@W is the last Call of Duty that features built in mod support, and custom zombies is fantastic and its main feature imo. The campaign is mildly racist and does at times make you want to friendly fire at your AI teammates, if you have played previous games or even current games in the COD series then the campaign is what you are familiar with, nothing outstanding. Who are we kidding though, if you are considering buying this game it's not for campaign, it's either for zombies or multiplayer. Now the multiplayer has two features that COD since W@W has lacked greatly, the ability to decimate your enemy and blow bits of them off, you are rewarded for headshots and using a trench gun can blow off someone's legs. As well as the ability to drive Tanks.  The main issue I have with multiplayer is the main issue I have with the few COD games I have played, that is the fact it rewards negative actions, for instance rushing headlong in to a hoard of enemies is possible and winable, and it tries to force you to do so.  Hit detection is iffy (downright dogshit at times) and can lead to some issues like shooting people around corners due to the size of their hitbox, however one definite perk to W@W is that unlike later COD games maps are less linear in design although not to a great extent to be fair and there are custom maps for both multiplayer and zombies.  Before you decide if you should buy it or not, it is to be noted that Punkbuster anti cheat is no longer supported and there are hackers/modders in fair amounts. You must find download a patch file to override the game in order to play multipler. There is also the issue of the server list not populating for a large number of people so to see servers you have to check gametracker or another such list. As an arcade style game it is not great but not terrible, saved for the most part for its excellent zombie hoard mode. All in all its a decent time but is fairly average in presentation and execution, I would rate it 5/10 for the games multiplayer and campaign. However for zombies its a solid 8/10 due to the customization and actual mod support.",1,ah call duty synonymous years olds least years pent rage isnt going entirely hate driven review point review community plays ww last call duty features built mod support custom zombies fantastic main feature imo campaign mildly racist times make want friendly fire ai teammates played previous games even current games cod series campaign familiar nothing outstanding kidding though considering buying game campaign either zombies multiplayer multiplayer two features cod since ww lacked greatly ability decimate enemy blow bits rewarded headshots using trench gun blow someones legs well ability drive tanks main issue multiplayer main issue cod games played fact rewards negative actions instance rushing headlong hoard enemies possible winable tries force hit detection iffy downright dogshit times lead issues like shooting people around corners due size hitbox however one definite perk ww unlike later cod games maps less linear design although great extent fair custom maps multiplayer zombies decide buy noted punkbuster anti cheat longer supported hackersmodders fair amounts must find download patch file override game order play multipler also issue server list populating large number people see servers check gametracker another list arcade style game great terrible saved part excellent zombie hoard mode decent time fairly average presentation execution would rate games multiplayer campaign however zombies solid due customization actual mod support

"CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best  game to ever have a crosshair. It is not a contact sport, so for the girly girls, it is an activity to indulge in.  It starts off with a team trying to kill another team.   I started playing cs when I noticed jacking off isn't the only activity to do on a computer. I started inviting a lot of friends out and getting drinks, as well as a boom box, to spend a nice summer day in the living room playing this wonderful game. I wanted to play every chance that i could. On my road of cs adventures, I encountered a couple of problems; those being that nobody was as fervent as I was about playing, and that when we did play, nobody was good enough, so it wasn't a lot of fun.  Then I discovered that I could sign up for a class with dboorn. I was overly excited, and signed up, but with skepticism at how the class was going to be. Sure enough, I was proven wrong. We started off by practicing a little bit. Then we split off into teams and started playing almost everyday of class. I made some friends, and played with people who had built up their skill gradually over the period of the course.  When I play counterstrike, the whole world disappears. Only I, the mouse, and my teammates remain. We are united in a common goal. We strive collectively towards an end we all desire. Each player has a spot to hold. They stand ready and waiting, eager for their chance to aid the team in what they hope will be a forthcoming victory. Thus, CS celebrates the unity of man, the indomitable spirit in all of us that pushes us and drives us towards excellence. When I play CS, I play until my veins pump battery acid, and then I play some more.  CS is unique among the games because it teaches all of us that no matter where we are in life, there is a role for us to play, and we can help our fellow man by fulfilling that role, and thereby our destiny. What destiny might you ask? I spoke before of unity. And it is that unity that brings us all together like one big loving family. That is the nature of counter-strike; the many working as one. One machine made of well oiled cogs and wheels, moving in unison, happy to play their part in the production of something greater than themselves. Not that these small metal objects are actually animate, I'm of course speaking only metaphorically.  Over the course of the years, I have increased in skill, but I have learned a greater lesson than how to be a better cs player. I have learned how to cooperate with a team to accomplish a goal that we all share. Even if that team is less than ideal. I have realized that cs is about more than just one's athletic ability. Instead, there is a deeper meaning behind the colt, the AK, the AWP, the deagle, the sands under my feet (in d2 or inferno). And more importantly, the teammates at my side. I love them. It is the human element of cs that gives cs its greatness.  In conclusion, I love cs. I love to win. I love pushing myself to my physical limits. It's that feeling that first drove me to the computer. For every second that I am not playing cs, there is only an unquenchable thirst to play. A thirst that grows as every minute passes by when I am outside, sitting at the television, or playing sports. I had an extraordinary time playing this game, and I will return to look at the future students of this game to see that bright eager look on their faces to remind me of how I used to feel. This review may be over, this game may be dead, but I will never stop playing couner-strike (1.6).",1,cs one greatest undermined games history opinion best game ever crosshair contact sport girly girls activity indulge starts team trying kill another team started playing cs noticed jacking isnt activity computer started inviting lot friends getting drinks well boom box spend nice summer day living room playing wonderful game wanted play every chance could road cs adventures encountered couple problems nobody fervent playing play nobody good enough wasnt lot fun discovered could sign class dboorn overly excited signed skepticism class going sure enough proven wrong started practicing little bit split teams started playing almost everyday class made friends played people built skill gradually period course play counterstrike whole world disappears mouse teammates remain united common goal strive collectively towards end desire player spot hold stand ready waiting eager chance aid team hope forthcoming victory thus cs celebrates unity man indomitable spirit us pushes us drives us towards excellence play cs play veins pump battery acid play cs unique among games teaches us matter life role us play help fellow man fulfilling role thereby destiny destiny might ask spoke unity unity brings us together like one big loving family nature counterstrike many working one one machine made well oiled cogs wheels moving unison happy play part production something greater small metal objects actually animate im course speaking metaphorically course years increased skill learned greater lesson better cs player learned cooperate team accomplish goal share even team less ideal realized cs ones athletic ability instead deeper meaning behind colt ak awp deagle sands feet inferno importantly teammates side love human element cs gives cs greatness conclusion love cs love win love pushing physical limits feeling first drove computer every second playing cs unquenchable thirst play thirst grows every minute passes outside sitting television playing sports extraordinary time playing game return look future students game see bright eager look faces remind used feel review may game may dead never stop playing counerstrike

"  The CS1.6 is the successor to Thiel's CS1.5, a denizen of this magazine's 'Recommended Components' listing ever since Sam Tellig enthused over it in August 1994. (He also wrote about it in May '96, while Muse Kastanovich's November '95 review included a full set of measurements.) Like the '1.5, the '1.6 is a floorstanding two-way design with a sloped-back front baffle. That's where the resemblance ends, however, as every other aspect of the 2002 speaker's design is new.  Whereas the CS1.5's baffle was flat, with step-backs for the hefty grille, the '1.6's is elegantly sculpted with a CNC machine to optimize dispersion, the minimal grille fitting into a shallow depression and held with concealed magnets. With the grille removed, the most obvious visible feature is a long vertical slot beneath the woofer, surrounded by a machined flare. This slot acts as the reflex port, but its geometry is claimed to minimize wind noise and any modification of its tuning by the grille.  The 6.5' woofer, designed and manufactured in-house, uses a 3' voice-coil to drive the metal cone closer to its perimeter than usual. This is said to increase the stiffness of the cone, pushing the inevitable breakup modes much higher in frequency than with a conventional cone and voice-coil. The large coil allows the neodymium magnet to be housed completely within the voice-coil former, inherently shielding the magnet. The 1' tweeter uses a metal dome and, like the woofer, features a short coil with a copper distortion-reducing ring, operating in a long gap. The tweeter dome is recessed slightly in a front plate with a short flare, which will increase its on-axis sensitivity to match the efficient woofer, at the expense of restricting the unit's dispersion in the top octave.  The crossover is, as is usual in Thiel's Coherent Source designs, a phase-optimal first-order type. This and the sloping back baffle allow the sounds from both drivers to arrive at the listener's ears at the same time. In a welcome departure from earlier Thiel speakers, the CS1.6's sturdy terminal posts are sited on the rear of its cabinet rather than the base.  Sound  Setting up the CS1.6s involved finding positions for them that gave the optimum balance among four nonrelated aspects of sound quality. The speaker's bass region is intrinsically shelved-down. However, moving the speakers close to the sidewalls to give some boundary reinforcement of the low frequencies also emphasized some residual hardness in the low treble, and resulted in a balance that was too bright with the speakers facing straight ahead. Moving the speakers well away from the sidewalls gave a sound that was clean and clear, but with insufficient bass. Keeping the speakers where they had the most extended bass but toeing them in so that they faced the listening seat reduced the hardness, added some useful top-octave air, and gave a soundstage that was superbly detailed and stable. On the downside, the overall sound was still a little bright for my tastes and system.  Ultimately, I moved each speaker forward along the line joining its acoustic center to the listening position, noting how the drop in bass weight was balanced by a corresponding drop in low-treble hardness. This sounds more straightforward than it was because the CS1.6's overall sound changed more during the break-in process than I am used to. Thiel recommends 50 hours 'at moderately loud levels,' but at the end of the month during which I used the Thiels for my everyday listening, I was still not sure that they'd reached equilibrium.  But what had begun as brightness had been transformed into superb resolution of detail. What had started out as a lightweight, not too well-defined low-frequency register ended up as a balance that worked well on such superb double-bass recordings as Edgar Meyer's new disc of concertos, by himself and Bottesini, with the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra (Sony Classical SK 60956).

I'll start off listing the positives:  + Still very active + Zombies are awesome + Modding/ Server Browser + Replayability is strong   Here are some negatives that come to mind: - Short 6 hour Campaign - Very loose story - Campaign difficulty is way to easy no matter what level - Occascional hackers  Overall this is a amazing game and I do recommend it to anyone obviously..

"Hey there! Remember all the good old gaming days? Searching for mix teams, joining up with some random dudes playing all night long? Totally missing some school days here and there? Then you probably, like me, played this game countless of hours.    You know all the default maps better than your first name and have surely tested out thousands of custom maps, hundreds of aim-maps, hundreds of KZ/jumping maps, Warcraft 3 mod (a mod to a game that was a mod, how ironic?), Zombie-mod, gungame mod, evenly and evilly slaughtered all your friends in deathmatch, met thousands of players from all around the world, even from Africa and pwned unimaginable amounts of hardcore and noob-players.    This game will absolutely never die, players will keep trying to find and therefor create new servers and the old PCW/mix-games are still going to be played in the silent even though the competetive gaming scene has gone over to CS:GO. And thank you scene for doing that. This game really needs the cult status in the shadow of newer and more refreshing games. Let it still be there, reminding newer generation of players how the good old times were. Let all the videos be there on youtube especially of the bigger contests. It makes me happy.   So, what is this game all about?  Well, it is simple. The main theme of the game is either 'bomb-planting terrorists vs bomb-defusing counter-terrorists', 'hostage-rescue-mode' or 'save the VIP-mode'. A competetive first person shooter game that has immersive action-packed gameplay all over your screen. You will most likely be flashed, smoked out, shot from far away by a sniper, spawnkilled by your sister, knifed by your brother, exploded by either a bomb or a thrown HE-granade or camped to death by a noob. Sounds good? Then join in the action!

"Call of Duty: World At War was quite surprising to me. I expected a somewhat 'old' game that was simply good for Zombies. When I acutally started playing it, then my mind was shocked. I first played the story mode to give it a little bit of a test run. I expected mediocre gameplay, but I was quite mistaken. The story mode transfers you to the battlefields of WW2. The whizzing bullets and voices yelling on the top of their lungs gave a surreal environment in which I felt that if I died in the game, I'd die in real life. And then at the end of the game, when I planted the flag on the Reichstag, I knew that victory was finally mine and I accomplished a significant achievement. Now let's flip the page to Zombies. You see, I had seen bits and pieces of WAW Zombies gameplay, and I only dabbled into the maps and story of it. But when the zombies spawned, I had a little bit of fear for my life. The Zombies environment pits you in a life or death situation. It's kind of like a dog eat dog world, except that I couldn't eat the other dog, and the other dog was actually an undead maniac trying to rip the flesh off my bones. Now to Multiplayer Now I'm gonna be honest here, but I've only touched the surface of multiplayer. So I can't really provide much feedback, but it's pretty fun  These are the reasons on why WAW is an absouletly amazing game and everyone should purchase it. JUST BUY IT. IT'S WORTH IT!",1,call duty world war quite surprising expected somewhat old game simply good zombies acutally started playing mind shocked first played story mode give little bit test run expected mediocre gameplay quite mistaken story mode transfers battlefields ww whizzing bullets voices yelling top lungs gave surreal environment felt died game id die real life end game planted flag reichstag knew victory finally mine accomplished significant achievement lets flip page zombies see seen bits pieces waw zombies gameplay dabbled maps story zombies spawned little bit fear life zombies environment pits life death situation kind like dog eat dog world except couldnt eat dog dog actually undead maniac trying rip flesh bones multiplayer im gonna honest ive touched surface multiplayer cant really provide much feedback pretty fun reasons waw absouletly amazing game everyone purchase buy worth

BUT  Its incredibly frustrating, for me games are supposed to be fun and this just isn't at times. The US campaigns especially are ruined by the sheer amount of bloody grenades and a gameplay is just hours of reading the 'watch the grenade indicator' caption. The lack of a savegame feature means if you don't hit a checkpoint you are doomed to relive the same bit over and over and over and over again to find after the 350th attempt (so it seems) you are just about there and you guessed it - bloody grenade!  TBH I'd give it a miss the frustration factor is just too much I'd rather a game that is actual fun not tedious and frustrating this is by far the worst COD game that I've played",-1,ive playing eyars still cant decide like graphics even todays great story immersive teamwork ai also well speed incredibly frustrating games supposed fun isnt times us campaigns especially ruined sheer amount bloody grenades gameplay hours reading watch grenade indicator caption lack savegame feature means dont hit checkpoint doomed relive bit find th attempt seems guessed bloody grenade tbh id give miss frustration factor much id rather game actual fun tedious frustrating far worst cod game ive played

"Not only was this game a Call of Duty I actually enjoyed, it is the best to buy for modding.  If you are a person who really liked modding the crap out of the Fallout's or Skyrim and you like FPS games, try this. The modding community is huge and the mods end up being better than any DLC that ever came out for CoD: WaW. I only purchased this game for Zombies and the mods. Multiplayer has not-so-abruptly gone to hell and the campaign for the game is sloppy and not at all anything to get in to. None of these things matter as long as you have a friend or two to play Zombies with and a well enough computer to play the game at 30FPS.  A great thing to note is the ease of co-op with Zombies: - Even the first time I played this it was really straightforward to set up a game with friends - Did NOT need to consult the internet at all regarding hosting - Doesn't run completely off your system in multiplayer so RAM is no issue  Definately a great buy and has lots of replay value.

"An excellent WW2 fps shooter if this is your kind of era. It uses the same engine that modern warfare was built on so expect some brilliant visuals and effects. I was a bit dissapointed at first when I realised you are only playing the single player from the perspective of the Amercians in the pacific and the Russians in Europe. I had kind of hoped there would have also been some British, German and Japanese levels but that aside the stories and battles you experience are done brilliantly. Don't expect hi-tec weaponry in this game like you get in MW. This is WW2 and there is no fancy stuff to help you here. It doesn't take long to finish the main campaign but there is a rather good extra level which is based around a nazi zombie survival game.  WW2 fans will probably like it but it may not be to the liking of all CoD followers.",1,excellent ww fps shooter kind era uses engine modern warfare built expect brilliant visuals effects bit dissapointed first realised playing single player perspective amercians pacific russians europe kind hoped would also british german japanese levels aside stories battles experience done brilliantly dont expect hitec weaponry game like get mw ww fancy stuff help doesnt take long finish main campaign rather good extra level based around nazi zombie survival game ww fans probably like may liking cod followers

The campain is great and tells two great stories from a russian and american's point of view. Multiplayer is great.

The console version has you buy the extra maps but this version has them for free plus you can get as many mod maps as you want. get your friends together for the modded maps cause they are the best. This Call Of Duty game is probably the best deal for any of the COD games you are gonna find on PC. And if you have troubles finding multiplayer servers just click 'refresh listing'.

Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

"Best game known to man-kind. No enhanced engine captures the reality of this original. 1.5 was even better. Per. Head-shot boxes have NEVER been the same and since VAC I miss seeing the cheaters getting caught Red-Handed and added to the International blacklist. I still keep a black book of every IP at the scene of any crimes. If you want to experience the original AWP trying playing OP4. Shoot opponent in the hand or foot and they are toast! If you are still mad that 'they' Cliff and whoever took the silencer off the Colt I got the SOB back. Visit  ANTPLA.NET  to get skin pack II. Original was from ~01 and is still downloadable as General Sphinx Brothers of Steel BOS skin pack. I was there playing UK's Ganstawars Last Man Standing Gameplay type messing with the bots skins trying to get CS skins on Gangstawar bots and enjoyed how one of them was invisible. Sort of like a prank. If you can tommygun invisible opponent you are like a Luke Skywalker bad a$$. Skin pack II has the 'Starwars' lightsaber replacement for knife and the AK to plasma rifle from 1980's movie 'Alien'. The skins out compete CSGO any day of the week with 400fps instead of stuck on 30 same kernel. I got a duo-core up to 1200fps. Well I should not have shared the knowlege with other gamers on the map because next thing you know everybody was doing it on their own character. [AU] DeathWish settled it when it got to CS with rainbow coloured animated reskins instead of them being invisible. My first game was CS Canyon_Siege and I was wondering why we all were moving around as ghost spectators. I am not the Prodigy Inc SPHINX. I have only made auto-admin called 3 forms of punishment. It was for Admin Mod then re-written for AMX. Lost. No need for it anymore anyway. People still found a way to hack with it and fly around the maps prior to hook and vote for matrix, etc. Give them enough rope and instead of being slapped, killed, kicked, ban was in effect for short period. Essentially you mixed 2 words with lag and server and other various buZz words like gay server all these got punishments set fourth. Talking crap about admin was a slaying. Lag was a slap. It was based off Trinity and the server was the spirit. If trash talk is about the 'spirit', that is not forgivable or rather as tolerated and the ban was automatically set. That resolved major breach of security. Suddenly there is no need to have tons of admins. Most of whom were there just to exploit code often unintentionally, due to buggy 3rd party plug-ins such as STATSME.",1,best game known mankind enhanced engine captures reality original even better per headshot boxes never since vac miss seeing cheaters getting caught redhanded added international blacklist still keep black book every ip scene crimes want experience original awp trying playing op shoot opponent hand foot toast still mad cliff whoever took silencer colt got sob back visit antplanet get skin pack ii original still downloadable general sphinx brothers steel bos skin pack playing uks ganstawars last man standing gameplay type messing bots skins trying get cs skins gangstawar bots enjoyed one invisible sort like prank tommygun invisible opponent like luke skywalker bad skin pack ii starwars lightsaber replacement knife ak plasma rifle movie alien skins compete csgo day week fps instead stuck kernel got duocore fps well shared knowlege gamers map next thing know everybody character au deathwish settled got cs rainbow coloured animated reskins instead invisible first game cs canyonsiege wondering moving around ghost spectators prodigy inc sphinx made autoadmin called forms punishment admin mod rewritten amx lost need anymore anyway people still found way hack fly around maps prior hook vote matrix etc give enough rope instead slapped killed kicked ban effect short period essentially mixed words lag server various buzz words like gay server got punishments set fourth talking crap admin slaying lag slap based trinity server spirit trash talk spirit forgivable rather tolerated ban automatically set resolved major breach security suddenly need tons admins exploit code often unintentionally due buggy rd party plugins statsme

"I would say its worth to buy if you wanne buy it for the campaign or the multiplayer.

Sometimes people do play it, but thats just a matter of waiting. If you are buying it for multiplayer, multiplayer is really fun, you have alot of servers with a lot of players, alot of modded servers aswell and custom anti-cheats.

"The last truly great Call of Duty game. Treyarch typically has done well since WaW, however the retention of stupid game elements made by Infinity Ward drags down Black Ops and Black Ops II (while they still remain much better than the Modern Warfare series past the first installment).   Unfortunately, it is sadly dead on all platforms for anything but Zombies or Campaign. PC is nothing but crouch servers. Xbox is nothing but hackers. PS3 is nothing at all - a complete lack of players. I'll never effectively be able to play this game's awesome multiplayer again because of this, but I will remember it fondly.  Anyways, I still recommend purchasing it now when it's on sale for the Zombies experience. Not only do you get all of the DLC maps (of which two are fantastic) for free, there are a bunch of custom maps made by players that expand upon Zombies immensely.",1,last truly great call duty game treyarch typically done well since waw however retention stupid game elements made infinity ward drags black ops black ops ii still remain much better modern warfare series past first installment unfortunately sadly dead platforms anything zombies campaign pc nothing crouch servers xbox nothing hackers ps nothing complete lack players ill never effectively able play games awesome multiplayer remember fondly anyways still recommend purchasing sale zombies experience get dlc maps two fantastic free bunch custom maps made players expand upon zombies immensely

The zombies mode, and more importantly, the modded zombies maps are what make this game. If you go on the Steam WaW forums you'll always manage to find people to play with if you don't already have friends to play it with. The custom made maps range from being absolutely horrifying to extremely comedic. There are probably hundreds if not thousands of maps online that you can download and play on (look up a tutorial on how to download them if you aren't sure). This leads to pretty much infinite entertainment. I'd definetly pick this game up, but if you're not sure, just look up modded WaW zombies videos on youtube and see if you like them!

"I have played this on and off years at this point(Revisiting it every now and then) and recently got a Steam copy from a Digital Deluxe Edition of Black Ops II. World at War is a good game. The story might not be brilliant, but the gameplay is good.  One thing that I always thought was a bit special about this Call of Duty title was the fact that it showed the horrors of war with burning soldiers, limbs being shot off by machineguns or blown off by grenades and artillery. It really doesn't pull the punches and I was very uncomfortable and at times horrified by a depiction of war getting ever closer to real life. It's part of why I recommend it. It's not just your average 'Oh I shot him, saw a little red and he fell down', there's more to it and you'll realize that war isn't as pretty as it is in previous Call of Duty games.  The thing is that some veterans have said that you eventually got used to the horrors of war and you do after a while as the game doesn't quite have the same impact on me as when I first played it. I still think it's a good war game, perhaps even a bit of a learning experience for people not realizing the hell that war is.  The only thing that I was ever disappointed with in the game was my expectation of it being wholly dedicated to the Pacific Campaign as it was not something that had been done in the previous games which all centered on the Western and Eastern European fronts and North Africa(With a little detour to Norway and the Mediterranean), but that's just me.  Overall it's an enjoyable game, fairly well-executed and, to reiterate, I'd say it can be a bit of an eye opener to people who haven't truly realized what war is.",1,played years pointrevisiting every recently got steam copy digital deluxe edition black ops ii world war good game story might brilliant gameplay good one thing always thought bit special call duty title fact showed horrors war burning soldiers limbs shot machineguns blown grenades artillery really doesnt pull punches uncomfortable times horrified depiction war getting ever closer real life part recommend average oh shot saw little red fell theres youll realize war isnt pretty previous call duty games thing veterans said eventually got used horrors war game doesnt quite impact first played still think good war game perhaps even bit learning experience people realizing hell war thing ever disappointed game expectation wholly dedicated pacific campaign something done previous games centered western eastern european fronts north africawith little detour norway mediterranean thats overall enjoyable game fairly wellexecuted reiterate id say bit eye opener people havent truly realized war

Well you ♥♥♥♥ wit World at Wars zombies mode takes the cake for me, you got 4 zombie maps that are ♥♥♥♥ing amazing and still amazing to this day, you got custom zombies which allow you to make great looking maps or you can be a dumbass and make ♥♥♥♥♥♥ maps with bugs all over the place.   In conclusion this game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing and it will always stay amazing and if I were to tell you which console you play this on ♥♥♥♥ THE CONSOLES IT'S A USELESS GAME ON XBOX AND PS WITH HACKERS AND LOSERS WHO BREAK THE GAME. PC is hands down the best option since you can get custom multiplayer servers and custom zombies plus hackers aren't a thing on World at War since PC is more up to date on fixing ♥♥♥♥ and you have mods/admins who actually care for the players that come into their servers.

"Everything about CoD WaW still amazes me. The campaign for this game is my favorite out of all of them, and is immersive. The OST that Treyarch put together to symbolize each moment really puts it together. While the zombies experience isn't as good as Black Ops, the game comes with all the maps included for free (at least on PC). The weapons found in world at war have a nostalgic feel, especially due to the sounds they make as they fire and reload. I can't say for sure where the multiplayer in this game is, because it is from the last decade. From my Xbox 360 experience on this game, it's definitely satisfying to get kills, with the headshot sounds being the most satisfying from any game, surpassing even CS:GO for me. I would definitely recommend this game for any price $20 or below.",1,everything cod waw still amazes campaign game favorite immersive ost treyarch put together symbolize moment really puts together zombies experience isnt good black ops game comes maps included free least pc weapons found world war nostalgic feel especially due sounds make fire reload cant say sure multiplayer game last decade xbox experience game definitely satisfying get kills headshot sounds satisfying game surpassing even csgo would definitely recommend game price

"Alright, so you've probably seen a ba-jillion reviews of this game (same as TF2) but I'm here to review it. My usual 10 hours of playtime: write a review. I ended up playing almost 30 hours of the game.  Call of Duty people have been saying is being repetitive and sometimes but not always I may agree with that statement but most definitely not for this one and many people will agree with me there.   Alright, so let's start with the campaign since this is going to be a long review... The campaign does start you off with a grusome scene which apparently some of my friends' parents do not enjoy.  Sticking A Cigarette In Someone's Eye- Walking Dead Style Once you get into the combat with a huge selection of (walk and pickup guns) and handheld and placeable guns, the first mission is quick and enjoyable. The campaign is excellent but does not hold much replayability unless there were achievements involved. My favorite mission is when you get captured and you snipe your way out of the area, that is the most stealthiest and most beyond unbelieveable mission in this whole game.   The multiplayer (FOR PC, not including Xbox, Wii, Playstation) is set up on servers which I DO NOT ENJOY. That's one of the very few things I don't like about this game. Most servers have beyond stupid rules including some of the most popular ones such as: crouching the whole game, or a certain gun only. Some are HIGH-XP and Moon Map Jumping abilities which I find funny and don't mind as long as it didn't affect me in a bad way which it didn't. To be honest I didn't find one regular playable server with no mod attached or hack. There was always one in that long list. Unless, one server that didn't have rules, mods or hacks HAD NO PLAYERS. Otherwise, the gun selection including the beyond amazing Thompson and MP40 in multiplayer are TONS of fun to use and mess around with. Maps are generic but in a good way, no push-able elevator buttons like in Ghosts or breakable glass like in most BO2 maps. Some of the modded maps including the Nacht Der Untoten map structed down is INCREDIBLE. I took maybe like 10 screenshots of me jumping high over maps. Multiplayer on PC is around a 7 due to the servers but on consoles a perfect 10.   Zombies- There are no words to describe zombies mode in this game. You could play zombies for days and not get bored. New ways to go, pack-a-punch different guns. Go to  UGXmods.com  and download maps for PLAYABILITY in the game, you can play fan-made maps including MW guns and AW guns and all sorts of cool stuff. I downloaded many community maps and still enjoy the first original 4 maps. Unlike the console, you get the original 4 maps for free instead of having to buy the DLC which I freaking love. Nacht Der Untoten is amazing, three rooms, no place to camp for very long except the weird room at the top with the stairway. The music easteregg and all the other maps are incredible, my personal favorite being Verruckt because it's small, there's perks, screams, it's a freaking pretty scary map if you break it down. No voices of the main brilliant characters: Dempsey, Takeo and the other guys. You cannot level up in zombies in Cooperative which I find dumb. So what? You're playing with other people on your rules, you should still be able to level up. Zombies is an 11/10  Other Stuff About The Game- On PC there are no achievements or trading cards which I wish there were. They could've added replayability into the campaign and make playing zombies a whole new challenge. The ability to get to your mod maps is the easiest, I didn't think it was going to be so easy until I tried it. They still add stuff to it (according to friends) today.   Verdict- You may think COD is generic, you haven't played this game, I'm sorry but you haven't lived. For 20 bucks and it's on sale a lot, it's a steal and you should buy it right now. There is no one I know who HASN'T heard of this game, there are some who haven't played but you should. Be first-player in zombies, you become Dempsey, my favorite character.",1,alright youve probably seen bajillion reviews game tf im review usual hours playtime write review ended playing almost hours game call duty people saying repetitive sometimes always may agree statement definitely one many people agree alright lets start campaign since going long review campaign start grusome scene apparently friends parents enjoy sticking cigarette someones eye walking dead style get combat huge selection walk pickup guns handheld placeable guns first mission quick enjoyable campaign excellent hold much replayability unless achievements involved favorite mission get captured snipe way area stealthiest beyond unbelieveable mission whole game multiplayer pc including xbox wii playstation set servers enjoy thats one things dont like game servers beyond stupid rules including popular ones crouching whole game certain gun highxp moon map jumping abilities find funny dont mind long didnt affect bad way didnt honest didnt find one regular playable server mod attached hack always one long list unless one server didnt rules mods hacks players otherwise gun selection including beyond amazing thompson mp multiplayer tons fun use mess around maps generic good way pushable elevator buttons like ghosts breakable glass like bo maps modded maps including nacht der untoten map structed incredible took maybe like screenshots jumping high maps multiplayer pc around due servers consoles perfect zombies words describe zombies mode game could play zombies days get bored new ways go packapunch different guns go ugxmodscom download maps playability game play fanmade maps including mw guns aw guns sorts cool stuff downloaded many community maps still enjoy first original maps unlike console get original maps free instead buy dlc freaking love nacht der untoten amazing three rooms place camp long except weird room top stairway music easteregg maps incredible personal favorite verruckt small theres perks screams freaking pretty scary map break voices main brilliant characters dempsey takeo guys cannot level zombies cooperative find dumb youre playing people rules still able level zombies stuff game pc achievements trading cards wish couldve added replayability campaign make playing zombies whole new challenge ability get mod maps easiest didnt think going easy tried still add stuff according friends today verdict may think cod generic havent played game im sorry havent lived bucks sale lot steal buy right one know hasnt heard game havent played firstplayer zombies become dempsey favorite character

Call of Duty: World at War was the first COD game to include zombies and I owned this on xbox at one point. it was fun but you had to pay for the extra maps. On PC you don't have to pay for any of the maps and even after they get boring the mods are endless and I mean that literally they are endless. I don't really enjoy multiplayer or the story mode so I can't say much about it but I have played the first 2 missions of story mode and from what I've played it seems pretty cool. Call Of Duty: World at War is 100% worth $40 and if you love COD Zombes you will love this game.,1,call duty world war first cod game include zombies owned xbox one point fun pay extra maps pc dont pay maps even get boring mods endless mean literally endless dont really enjoy multiplayer story mode cant say much played first missions story mode ive played seems pretty cool call duty world war worth love cod zombes love game

"Call of Duty: World at War is my favorite call of duty of all time. This is when call of duty was still fresh, and didnt completely rehash the same game over and over and over again. This game is unlike any call of duty youve played. Believe me. It introduced the Zombies Gamemode, which is great, as well as has a great multiplayer. The weapons are all original, the Campaign is fun. There is Co-Op campaign (2-4 Players) in which im not sure why it isnt in the newer call of duties. Co-Op works very well and is very fun. This game by today's standards is very overlooked and not seen as what it deserves. For 20$, this is a good deal. I reccommend you give this game a try, you would probably like it.",1,call duty world war favorite call duty time call duty still fresh didnt completely rehash game game unlike call duty youve played believe introduced zombies gamemode great well great multiplayer weapons original campaign fun coop campaign players im sure isnt newer call duties coop works well fun game todays standards overlooked seen deserves good deal reccommend give game try would probably like

"Man, this game was so much fun on the old Xbox 360. Too bad the community died and the game was hacked to death. I saw it on sale, and I decided to buy it. It turns out that the game is even better on PC than it was on console. I'll split this review into 3 subsections: Single player, Multiplayer, and Zombies.  SINGLE PLAYER: The campaign to this game is awesome. It will make you ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Sure, the graphics might be dated, but they've actually aged fairly well. However, these are not the focus here. My main concern is with the action and the story, and this game delivers. There is so much variety, and this creates many memorable scenarios. Raiding Japanese bunkers with the M2 flamethrower, mowing down banzai scouts with the Browning, sniping Germans in Stalingrad   Enemy at the Gates   style, shooting down Zeros and kamikaze pilots are just a few of the epic actions you will do. The character development and story is great, as almost every character has some depth. Reznov is a simple man, turned savage by the horrors of war. Chernov is a pacifist, unwillingly sucked into the global conflict. Polonsky is an innocent young man, fighting for what he believes is right. This is my favorite single player campaign of all time, and for that I rank this part a solid 10/10.  Multiplayer: While still facing some issues, the multiplayer here is actually more balanced and safer from hackers than it ever was on console. This is probably because the game was released back when Activision cared about PC, the presence of actual servers, and the PunkBuster software. The MP40 is no longer an unstoppable beast. I actually see every weapon in the game being used when I play. On console, it was all just STG44, MP40, and Springfield. Granted, the perks could use adjustment, and the explosive spam can be a pain, but it is still exciting and solid multiplayer. I grant it an 8/10.  Zombies: This is my favorite iteration of Zombies. I really don't care much for the whole 'find the secret easter egg using the magic gun so you can find more obscure details of this insane plot' nonsense the new Call of Duty games have. This is just straight up, no nonsense zombies. I love this arcadey style. It's not something that can be endlessly binged upon, but that's what the devs were originally going for. It was supposed to be something special, somthing you could play for an hour or two, get the best guns and survive for as long as possible. Also, there are literally thousands of custom zombies maps online that you can plaay, so if you're into the infinite depth and replayability, have at it. I give this 9/10.  In conclusion, I give this game a solid 9/10. It's not perfect, but it's a fine game, and well worth the money. I already have 15 hours, and I guarantee I'll be coming back for more.",1,man game much fun old xbox bad community died game hacked death saw sale decided buy turns game even better pc console ill split review subsections single player multiplayer zombies single player campaign game awesome make sure graphics might dated theyve actually aged fairly well however focus main concern action story game delivers much variety creates many memorable scenarios raiding japanese bunkers flamethrower mowing banzai scouts browning sniping germans stalingrad enemy gates style shooting zeros kamikaze pilots epic actions character development story great almost every character depth reznov simple man turned savage horrors war chernov pacifist unwillingly sucked global conflict polonsky innocent young man fighting believes right favorite single player campaign time rank part solid multiplayer still facing issues multiplayer actually balanced safer hackers ever console probably game released back activision cared pc presence actual servers punkbuster software mp longer unstoppable beast actually see every weapon game used play console stg mp springfield granted perks could use adjustment explosive spam pain still exciting solid multiplayer grant zombies favorite iteration zombies really dont care much whole find secret easter egg using magic gun find obscure details insane plot nonsense new call duty games straight nonsense zombies love arcadey style something endlessly binged upon thats devs originally going supposed something special somthing could play hour two get best guns survive long possible also literally thousands custom zombies maps online plaay youre infinite depth replayability give conclusion give game solid perfect fine game well worth money already hours guarantee ill coming back

"I've played this game since I was around 6 years old back in 2002 and it still makes me laugh and have fun whenever I launch it to this very day. Over 12 years of endless entertainment. No other game on this planet has given me more entertainment and enjoyment than Counter-Strike 1.6 has and I doubt no game ever will.  Reason i've only got 38 hours here is because I no longer use the account I originally played cs 1.6 on.   func_vehicle is what makes this Counter Strike game the best out of all the others in the franchise.  Find a server that has car maps or maps with func_vehicle entities and you will have endless fun running over teammates and enemies in all kinds of hilarious and goofy vehicles not giving a care in the world.  You can drive a fork with a meatball on the end of it. Do i need to say more?  Mods on this game are amazing too. There is a mod where you can catch pokemon, level them up, train them and use their skills.

"Not really sure about this game. The theatrics of it make it relatively entertaining but there are some really OBNOXIOUS things that ruin the experience.   First off, the programming is a nightmare. This game crashes, a lot. Trying to play through on veteran is one thing, but trying to play through on veteran, have the game crash, and having to start ALL over again when you were almost done with the stage is infuriating. The gernades are a joke, sometimes they work, sometimes they dont. The enemies gernades? They work flawlessly everytime even if you're away from the faintest indicator it doesn't matter, you're almost dead from looking at it.   Second off, some of the design choices in the game itself also ruin the experience. I can be walking along a path, NOTHING is in my way, but its the path the game designers want me to not go because reasons? Sometimes I am more scared of knee high debree than bullets. These end up getting you killed because you think you're running for cover sometimes but you have no idea where you can and can't go because of the phantom menace. Its a lazy design choice that really takes a wet shart all over the trousers of the game.  I will say that I love the voice acting choices for the main characters, Oldman and Sutherland knock it out of the park. I recommend this game literally for two reasons, the voice acting and the violence. This is by far the most violent call of duty out of the entire series. Blowing limbs off with a trench gun (shotgun) is enormously satisfying when it's one burtfurker after anurther. The flamethrower has to be one of the greatest things since the chainsaw in Doom, listening to screams of the ignited is beautiful. I cannot speak for it's historical accuracy but non of it feels out of place, it's just annoying when you're blocked by knee high debree or invisible walls when you're trying to bury your sausage.",1,really sure game theatrics make relatively entertaining really obnoxious things ruin experience first programming nightmare game crashes lot trying play veteran one thing trying play veteran game crash start almost done stage infuriating gernades joke sometimes work sometimes dont enemies gernades work flawlessly everytime even youre away faintest indicator doesnt matter youre almost dead looking second design choices game also ruin experience walking along path nothing way path game designers want go reasons sometimes scared knee high debree bullets end getting killed think youre running cover sometimes idea cant go phantom menace lazy design choice really takes wet shart trousers game say love voice acting choices main characters oldman sutherland knock park recommend game literally two reasons voice acting violence far violent call duty entire series blowing limbs trench gun shotgun enormously satisfying one burtfurker anurther flamethrower one greatest things since chainsaw doom listening screams ignited beautiful cannot speak historical accuracy non feels place annoying youre blocked knee high debree invisible walls youre trying bury sausage

"If you thought people dont play old games anymore, you're wrong. Counter-Strike is still a game with LOTS of players playing, despite the game being 15 years old so far. If you have a bad PC, dont worry, because Counter-Strike can run on almost any computer!  With excellent controls, skilled players, good graphics (for its time), a big variety of guns, the huge amount of servers, the anti-cheat system, good level design (official maps), Counter-Strike is one of the greatest FPS of all-time, and I think everyone should get this game as it is cheap.   If you are a retrogamer and you never played Counter-Strike yet, you gotta do it. You wont get disapointed. Not at all.  I dont have much to say about Counter-Strike... its just so good... everything about it has already been said by others... what should I say now?   if you think Counter-Strike would be a bad purchase, you're commiting a serious error.

"The games dead. Its basically worthless to anyone in USA unless you want to play with third worlders. Even then theres only a few servers it looks like. I would rather die than play with South Americans. Anything south of the US border is just hell ( I have never had a positive experience online with these people and if you know anything about geopolitics I need not go into that), so I advise not dealing with these peoples idiocy and just going with CSGO these days unless you want to LAN this game.  One of the greatest FPS games to ever come out and will forever remain a classic but also a game that can still compete design and gameplay wise with games released in more current times. We will never have the natural form of support from players and ESPORTS ever again. This is before ESports was just a way for devs to market and shill a game. This was from when people who liked to play a game competed and not just a bunch of rich kids trying to win monetary prizes like ESports is now (who else could play CSGO all day erry day in this economy?)  People got behind this game because they liked it, instead CSGO is all about market manipulation and human psychology manipulating with less consideration about gameplay because they want the most monetary return. If the idiots will pay hundreds for a digital knife skin then why would any company invest in gameplay that won't have direct returns like a digital nongood would have?  The video game market is full of idiots who will dump money into anything now just so they can distract themselves from the politcs, economics, and slowly declining living conditions of the western world. Bread and circus in its truest form.  CS 1.6 is from better days, more honest days. When people who wanted to make games, and people who wanted to play games were very closely related and the average IQ of someone who was online was higher than now. These days every idiot has an internet connection. That is to say, the target audience then was just better than the target audiences of todays games. This is exampled many times in economics.

"Welcome to another episode of Agrobal reviews an 'FPS' :D  Just as I was about to expect the same from every Call of Duty game, I get surprised by this campaign. It reminds me a lot of CoD pre-mainstream era. I actually like this campaign a lot. The usual running and gunning here and there. Annoying japanese soldiers that wont stop saying BANZAAAAIIII. Kiefer Sutherland's voice is magical. Maybe it is his voice that acts like a spell I am under. The gameplay is the same. I'd like to bring up the fact that I noticed in every CoD campaign, the player is a grenade magnet. At one point I was late reach an objective, the AI was ready to ambush me with 4 grenades at once--BOOM. Nothing underwhelming here, I am just glad I turned a blind eye after finishing the campaign and reading 'zombies'.",1,welcome another episode agrobal reviews fps expect every call duty game get surprised campaign reminds lot cod premainstream era actually like campaign lot usual running gunning annoying japanese soldiers wont stop saying banzaaaaiiii kiefer sutherlands voice magical maybe voice acts like spell gameplay id like bring fact noticed every cod campaign player grenade magnet one point late reach objective ai ready ambush grenades onceboom nothing underwhelming glad turned blind eye finishing campaign reading zombies

"169 Hours on Record at the time of this review. Call of Duty; World at War can be very fun. I have played the Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies. The Multiplayer (for me) lasted about 20 minutes, the Campaign is fun with a friend, but it can get repetitve, and Zombies was the bomb. Custom Zombies, Custom Zombies, Custom Zombies... Did I already mention Custom Zombies? Treyarch actually released mod tools for this title and a Radiant. It does take knowledge and time to learn to use the Radiant and the tools (not to mention the time to find them, ugh), but once you get settled in, it can be fun playing your own maps with your friends. Treyarch could have tried harder and cared more when making these tools, to be honest. I liked it, I guess... I recommend Treyarch does properly construct these tools, once more for the most recent title containing Zombies.",1,hours record time review call duty world war fun played campaign multiplayer zombies multiplayer lasted minutes campaign fun friend get repetitve zombies bomb custom zombies custom zombies custom zombies already mention custom zombies treyarch actually released mod tools title radiant take knowledge time learn use radiant tools mention time find ugh get settled fun playing maps friends treyarch could tried harder cared making tools honest liked guess recommend treyarch properly construct tools recent title containing zombies

"I don’t believe there is any gamer out there who doesn’t know Counter-Strike. It took CS a long way of over 10 years to reach the point where it is right now. And certainly CS 1.6 played the leading part in this adventure. This game is the closest to be the father of all FPS games. It is not as old as Wolfenstein and does not have beastly graphics like Battlefield but CS 1.6 did not need those aspects to have a special place amongst all games.

"Counter-Strike 1.6 is easily one of the best shooters out there. I have good history of making teams and playing against other teams or just having fun with friends in public servers. It was out of this world when it came out and in my opinion had the best professional scene at the time. I played it on and off for about 7 years.   Bud sadly CS 1.6 doesn't hold up for me. Until playing CSGO I was still very into the game. After playing CSGO for few months I tried playing CS 1.6 again, but the graphics and shooting mechanics are just awful at this point, it just doesn't hold up.  If you are new to gaming or just Counter-Strike, you should probably skip this game and just go right to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

"This is my first favorite Call Of Duty Game. I'm really fan these kind of shooters and even those old Call Of Duty Games. But i'm recommending this game because is the Last World War 2 game from the Franchise. If you're new on Cod games, it is one of MUST PLAY on PC for me!. The game has every DLC, Everybody can get access on the code console, Custom maps, No squeaky kids on Multiplayer, no Youtubers, No clans, No Optic Gaming and No Faze Clan, Mods, Mods on Multiplayer and last Custom Zombies AND ZERO QUICKSCOPE!. But the contras is it doesn't have the Archievements that really supported on the PS3/X360 Consoles due the Cheat codes on the ingame CMD. It has better graphics than the Black Ops PS3 version for my opinion. My first Cod game was Call Of Duty 3 so i'm from the old generation. And i hope Treyarch could launch Cod3 someday.   Just buy the game and enjoy the Darkest World War 2 Experience!, And if you're getting bored check out the MODS! The mods keeps the game ALIVE!.",1,first favorite call duty game im really fan kind shooters even old call duty games im recommending game last world war game franchise youre new cod games one must play pc game every dlc everybody get access code console custom maps squeaky kids multiplayer youtubers clans optic gaming faze clan mods mods multiplayer last custom zombies zero quickscope contras doesnt archievements really supported psx consoles due cheat codes ingame cmd better graphics black ops ps version opinion first cod game call duty im old generation hope treyarch could launch cod someday buy game enjoy darkest world war experience youre getting bored check mods mods keeps game alive

I never buy Call Of Duty games since they've gone to a horrible loop of the same thing every year just with some new gimmicks such as in Advanced Warfare with exosuits. But prettymuch any and all Call Of Duty games made by treyarch are fun entertaining, and have a great replay value.

"While I haven't played a lot of WaW on Steam, I've dumped hundreds of hours into it on the PS3. It's truly an amazing COD game and one of my favorites.  The campaign is great. Not perfect, but it's done well enough that it's fun to play and stays fresh. There is an American and Soviet campaign (In the Pacific and Eastern theatres respectively), and both are balanced, so after playing 3 missions in the Pacific, you're now in Berlin.  Mutiplayer is good. Pretty dead and full of hackers nowadays, but if you can find a server or play with some friends, go for it.  Personally, I think the crown of this game is the zombies mode. The community is still active and well (For an 8 year old game, that's impressive), and zombies have become a staple of some of the series' nock-offs. Get the UGX installer, some friends, and download a map. You're good to go. I purchased the PC port of this game /alone/ for custom zombies with friends, and I don't regret it.  You'll enjoy it.

"This game is actually fun, Awesome Campaign pretty nice and Awesome Multiplayer Gamemodes espacially the Gamemode where is like a giant war. Both of those gamemodes aren't why COD World At War is really amazing. Is the Zombies Gamemode. The first time that i played it on the orginal Call of Duty Zombies Map : Nacht Der Untoten also called Night of the living dead i think. Was a really amazing introduction to Zombies. It was so basic. Barriers, 1 box location, some old ww2 weapons, no perks and Pack A Punch and Some ''NAZI ZOMBIES''. Verrukt and Nacht Der Untoten Didn't really have anything to do with the Zombie Storyline (Waw (Nacht and Verrukt), BO1 (All map except Five and the Special Arcade) and the BO2 Zombies). After seeing AW ''Exo'' Zombies, i was kinda dissapoint but kinda happy that it is better then Tranzit. The perks from the original had very cool names. Sledgehammer (MW3 Developers) took the perks add 1-2 new ones and change original perks name and gave them stupid nerd name. The map is tiny and they didn't make much effort to the map and their upgrade weapon machine is like upgrade 20 times (or 25 if you did the easter egg) is actually not very helpful. On Zombies you just PAP once and your good for 15 rounds compare to Exo Zombies upgrade once and youll need to reupgrade before next round start because ammo on their gun is really really low. Big cons about it is that PAP to max cost way much then normal Zombies. Zombies : 5000 points and 2500 points (only on guns on BO2.) to add an attachement make an total of 7500 points and that Exo Zombies : 2500 X 25 (max times that you can upgrade the same gun) 62500 points. I know Sledgehammer can't copy right but couldn't atleast add an similar wonder weapon like the Ray gun? Really, the EM1, you kinding me Sledgehammer, pass round 19 is like big ♥♥♥♥ even upgraded. Only if there was a perk just like PHD that can block the electric zombies that disconnected your Exo Suit or you it reduces time of disconnection from it. It will be awesome if they actually did added that everysingle time you die is the first perk you loose. I don't say that AW is bad but i only like the campaign and multiplayer from it.

And since Bad Company 2 exists and does vehicles (and everything else too for that matter) so much better, I can't think of a reason to ever play another CoD game again.

"Gameplay: 10/10 LAN Fun: 3/3  Good Servers: 2/7  Counter-Strike, perhaps the most competitive game of it's time, hasn't aged well graphics-wise, but the gameplay remains more precise and consistent than most FPS games today. This game is a  great  LAN game for get-togethers, but otherwise you may have come too late on perhaps one of the greatest games of all time. Servers that I have connected to show that I have horrible ping, and the lag assures me of that. I have come across a server or two that I can connect to and enjoy, as well as being vanilla-CS, considering all the servers that mainly run modded games (which is about 4/5 of the servers). So here are the reasons to buy the original Counter-Strike:   Pros  -Can run on a potato -Plays smoothly no matter the settings. (However, you can connect to a server somewhere in Latin America or the Middle East, and lag like heck.) -Great fun to play with friends, as it can get really competitive, but at the same time your friends may not have this ancient gem, so this is dependent on the situation. -Solid gameplay. Nothing else really compares to the precision that went into it over the years. -Large map selection, as well as custom-maps found all over the internet. -Mods, but many are not as good as some of the others. You have to dig through garbage to find the fun ones.   Cons  -Very few good servers -Hard to convince people that don't already know how great this game is to buy it, considering it's more than a decade old. -So...many...sound...file...downloads...from...servers... -Custom maps are very rarely as balanced as maps packed in with the game.   Verdict  If you've got the money, and are curious as to what this legendary game is like, then it wouldn't be a complete waste, but if you are coming here from the latest CS or CoD or Battlefield, without having played other older FPS games, then you might regret the buy because this is a game that is quite outdated in terms of UI and such, and might not be appealing.  Overall 7/10 now, after more than a decade since release.",1,gameplay lan fun good servers counterstrike perhaps competitive game time hasnt aged well graphicswise gameplay remains precise consistent fps games today game great lan game gettogethers otherwise may come late perhaps one greatest games time servers connected show horrible ping lag assures come across server two connect enjoy well vanillacs considering servers mainly run modded games servers reasons buy original counterstrike pros run potato plays smoothly matter settings however connect server somewhere latin america middle east lag like heck great fun play friends get really competitive time friends may ancient gem dependent situation solid gameplay nothing else really compares precision went years large map selection well custommaps found internet mods many good others dig garbage find fun ones cons good servers hard convince people dont already know great game buy considering decade old somanysoundfiledownloadsfromservers custom maps rarely balanced maps packed game verdict youve got money curious legendary game like wouldnt complete waste coming latest cs cod battlefield without played older fps games might regret buy game quite outdated terms ui might appealing overall decade since release

"This game made me want to puke... I really gaged! And that's great. You see... When you develop a game, EVERYTHING is thought. there are no rocks that are where they are for no reason. When you show the player something, it's because you want him to think or feel something. To experience. That's why videogames are sometimes called 'interactive experiences'.  And this game made me feel like I really were in WW2.  I won't give many details, I don't want to spoil the experience. But let me tell you something from the campaign: I felt the despair and desperation of the marines. I felt the anger for my 'motherland'. I was afraid from the red army and angry with the germans when I played as the soviets. And I felt the horror of war. I was afraid of the bullets, of the explosions. I always runned from a granade instead of throwing it again unless it landed basically on my hand.  And the gore... Oh man... It really was a nice touch for the experience.  Seeing my 'friends' being blown to pieces made me angry, made me brave. Seeing my enemy scream while looking at his missing leg made me feel satisfaction... And made me feel ashamed.  The sounds, the graphics, the music... All are awesome. Even to this day. Going back to WW2 was the best choice activision could take. And not censoring it really helped.  PLEASE play this game. But NOT for the multiplayer... Hackers ruined it. Specailly aiming bot users.",1,game made want puke really gaged thats great see develop game everything thought rocks reason show player something want think feel something experience thats videogames sometimes called interactive experiences game made feel like really ww wont give many details dont want spoil experience let tell something campaign felt despair desperation marines felt anger motherland afraid red army angry germans played soviets felt horror war afraid bullets explosions always runned granade instead throwing unless landed basically hand gore oh man really nice touch experience seeing friends blown pieces made angry made brave seeing enemy scream looking missing leg made feel satisfaction made feel ashamed sounds graphics music awesome even day going back ww best choice activision could take censoring really helped please play game multiplayer hackers ruined specailly aiming bot users

"This Call of Duty title is unlike any other and started the zombie craze that has impacted the CoD community over the years. The World War II frontiers are nothing new to the series but added a decent graphical standard to what games were like back in 2008. The graphics in CoD today are still similar, however, this one seemed a bit more dark and were able to capture the setting very well. The characters might be forgettable in this title, but the moments that a player shares with the characters are truly memorable. For me, this Call of Duty was my first game on the XBOX 360 and will hold a special place as one of the most solid CoD titles to date. For new PC users who are looking to get a grip of CoD on their machines, this is a good place to start!

"So yeah...The axis powers are at it again....Trying to take over the world. So once again you have to strap on your boots and helmet, pick up your rifle and show those axis powers that you are taking no prisoners. So does Call of Duty live up the its name? Lets find out shall we.  Story: 5/10 ************  The story is pretty simple. You are are fighting World War 2 through the eyes of two soldiers. The American soldier Private C. Miller whom fights in the the Pacific War Theater and the Russian soldier Dimitri Petrenko, whom fights on the easten front from Stalingrad to Berlin. There are almost no cliffhangers or plottwists. As I stated at first its mainly about fighting World War II.  Graphics: 9/10 ****************  When it comes to the graphics Call of Duty certainly does not dissapoint. It runs on the engine that was used to make Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. Everything looks really photorealistic From the weapons, to landscapes to characters. Its even so detailed, that you can see the small fabric sewings on the cloth. The game is overall darkish at almost all times. This is to portrait the dark and gloomy ambience of the game, which it does perfectly. Explosions and water effects are nice done, although I have seen better water effects, they are acceptable. The explosions however are really something to behold. Smoke also looks pretty nice. The reload animations are pretty tight. Now if there is something I have penchant for it is reload styled animations. Something every connoiseur and aficianado of FPS should love. There is nothing more aesthetic than slamming in a new clip and then reload it in a really stylish and bad ♥♥♥♥ way.  Sound: 8/10 *************  The sound department is repleted with amazing sounds. The music goes from classic to more up-beat techno. I especially relished the up-beat soundtrack that plays when you are onboard one of those heavy armed airplanes. Explosion sounds amazing. If you have a good headset or stereo with bass, crank up the volume and feel the power of the explosions. The really makes it more believing and immersive in the game. The gun sounds I am not to fond off. They sound like toy guns and are really not that engaging. The sounds of the germans and japanese soliders is also amazing. Although the germans voices is just a rehash used in Call of Duty 2. The japanese sounds can get a bit vexing, because the most one that you will hear is:'Banzai! Tenno haka banzai!' Last in this I cannot stress enough, get yourself a really good headset. Becaue the music and the sound explosions are amazing. The guns are all right, although again they sound like toy guns.   Gameplay: 10/10 ******************* Now here comes the main core of the the Call of Duty genre. The gameplay really stands out among its predecessors and other shooters for the matter. Not by introducing new gameplay mechanics but by that it is really well made. First of Call of Duty World at War runs really smooth. The gameplay is not clunky, nor is it slow. It runs really smooth. When crouching and ducking, even aiming it runs smooth. Basically its the same as all the other Call of Duty games. Aim your gun, shoot, find cover, through some nades, complet objectives. Its really simple. But so much fund, engaging and immersive. The AI is somewhat okay, although I didnt enounter some instances where they just stood still and took it in the a**** like some dimwitted boffons. The enemies are good at finding cover, flanking you, and force you out of cover by throwing grenades at your position. Some enemy tactics consists of banzaing your position which the japanese soldiers will do offen. Now one of the things what makes Call of Duty World at War are the weapons. In Call of Duty 2 and the other Call of Duty (in my opinion) had lackluster of more powerful weaponry. Take Call of Duty 2 for instance. In that game you basically use 2 guns. Rifles and submachine guns. Rifle or long range, and then submachine guns for close range. Now imagine this. You are gong to clear a bunker. You have 2 choices of weapons. First your rifles, which have way to slow fire rate in close range. Second you have submachineguns, but those guns are to weak to clear a larger group of enemies. You are really craving for the more powerful weapons. Like machineguns, grenade launchers and flamethrowers. Call of Duty 2 did have more powerful weapons, but in all honesty those weapons were *really* scarce. World at War introduces new weponry like the flamethrower and grenadelauncher for Garand and powerful machine guns. Your outload is really diversified, which bothers me to some extent, I mean sometimes you have a bolt action rifle and a pistol, the next you have a machine and a flamethrower. Weird. But as stated earlier more powerful weapons were scarce, well not in World at War. World at War is like Super Mario World for SNES on steroids. The simply throw weapons at you like crazy. Weapons are all over the place. I mean you cannot move more than 30m then you find machineguns and grenade launchers. And thats what I like about World at War. It cuts right through the bulls**** and simply arm you with the best that the game can offer, right from the beginning of game. The really prepare you for the challenges ahead. Its not like in other shooters where you have to earn the guns or buy them were they are super expensive. So that where I think it stands out, because it is not something that i have seen in recent games.  Overall: 10/10 **************** So all in all I give this game a 10 out of 10 This is simply a masterpiece of a shooter, when not considering the story. So do i recommend it? Of course with a score of 10/10 and with more than 3000+ hours in that game, I really encourage you to buy it. Every FPS fan should experience this masterpiece of a shooter.

"Another great addition to the Call Of Duty series, World At War. I remember first getting this game slapping the disk in my PS3 disk drive and downloading it right away. Multiplayer for me was great, the MP40 was the only gun I really used and always will. The multiplayer offered great servers (in my opinion) along with a fairly fun and enjoyable system that came with challenges for each gun. Zombies was the highlight of World At War simply because it was quite unique to have such a thing introduced to a First Person shooter. What was very catchy about Zombies was how unexpected it was, I think it was rather unexpected for Call Of Duty to release such a thing was because of how the game was set out. I hadn't played much of the previous Call Of Duty's but I did realise that Zombies was a step up from what I initially assumed Call Of Duty was aiming for. I think that because of Zombies this specific game got a lot more recommendations; I'm not saying that if Zombies wasn't in this game it wouldn't be popular I'm just establishing that this Zombies simply grabbed the attention of many users. Along with attention it grabbed hours upon hours of gameplay. I think what Call Of Duty did which was rather annoying, in my opinion, was to charge extra for the addon map packs for Zombies. I didn't like this simply because of the initial net worth that Call Of Duty: World At War was estimated and I thought that having the extra charge quite a naughty move from Call Of Duty. Nevertheless the Campaign was great aswell as it was set in quite a horrific time, especially when you start off watching one of your fellow associates die in cold blood. The campaign offered quite an eye opening view on what life was like for soldiers in war, it also was rather reminiscful on how gory it really was and the struggles that soldiers faced each day.",1,another great addition call duty series world war remember first getting game slapping disk ps disk drive downloading right away multiplayer great mp gun really used always multiplayer offered great servers opinion along fairly fun enjoyable system came challenges gun zombies highlight world war simply quite unique thing introduced first person shooter catchy zombies unexpected think rather unexpected call duty release thing game set hadnt played much previous call dutys realise zombies step initially assumed call duty aiming think zombies specific game got lot recommendations im saying zombies wasnt game wouldnt popular im establishing zombies simply grabbed attention many users along attention grabbed hours upon hours gameplay think call duty rather annoying opinion charge extra addon map packs zombies didnt like simply initial net worth call duty world war estimated thought extra charge quite naughty move call duty nevertheless campaign great aswell set quite horrific time especially start watching one fellow associates die cold blood campaign offered quite eye opening view life like soldiers war also rather reminiscful gory really struggles soldiers faced day

"In my opinion, this is a nearly perfect game. It has an ok story, but you will overlook that very quickly as the gameplay and atmosphere captures the horror of World War 2 flawlessly, in both plot lines. In the first plot line, you play as an American soldier battling the Japanese, trying to capture an island that is full of booby traps and relentless enemies. This is a very cool way to play, with close quarters combat and ambushes aplenty, making the gameplay very suspenseful. In the other plotline, you play as a Russian soldier, firstly trying desperately to survive during a massive German invasion of a Russian town, then four years later, in 1945, you enter Germany and Berlin and brutally crush the German empire in what is a very satisfying set of levels. The first mission where you play as the Russian soldier is absolutely groundbreaking, filled with suspense and a dark, powerful atmosphere as you try to escape from the overkill that are the Nazis. Gameplay is your average Call of Duty game, it's fun and addictive, but on harder difficulty modes, it is extremely frustrating. Even on the easiest difficulty, you can bet that enemies will throw 3 grenades all aimed at you with no time to react. The Campaign is very entertaining and while short it has plenty of powerful moments, ESPECIALLY the ending, that was one of the best moments in a game, ever. The game looks absolutely beautiful, for a person that has to run PayDay 2 on lowest settings windowed to get 30 FPS it looks fantastic, even on lowest settings. The music is stunning, even right when you start the game you hear a track that grabs you into the game. Sadly, Campaign Co-op is dead and no-one plays it, so be sure to get friends if you want to play the Campaign with someone. Multiplayer is very good. On the XBox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game, it is notorious for everyone to hack and spoil the game. Oddly, on the PC version, where it is far easier to cheat, you barely see any cheaters. In general, Multiplayer is very well alive and still has a lot of players to this very day, which is good, because multiplayer is very entertaining and amusing to playthrough online. Last, but certainly not least, the arcade-style Nazi Zombies mode. This is one of the best modes ever to be added to a video game, and would you believe it was added last minute? While the Zombies mode in Call of Duty: Black Ops is flawless and (for some extra money) contains all the WaW maps remastered, it's still incredibly fun, and if you ask a friend to play Zombies with you, they usually accept. Overall, this is an excellent game and one that should definitely be in your Steam library. Just, don't get it full price, for this old of a game paying £20 is just plain stupid.",1,opinion nearly perfect game ok story overlook quickly gameplay atmosphere captures horror world war flawlessly plot lines first plot line play american soldier battling japanese trying capture island full booby traps relentless enemies cool way play close quarters combat ambushes aplenty making gameplay suspenseful plotline play russian soldier firstly trying desperately survive massive german invasion russian town four years later enter germany berlin brutally crush german empire satisfying set levels first mission play russian soldier absolutely groundbreaking filled suspense dark powerful atmosphere try escape overkill nazis gameplay average call duty game fun addictive harder difficulty modes extremely frustrating even easiest difficulty bet enemies throw grenades aimed time react campaign entertaining short plenty powerful moments especially ending one best moments game ever game looks absolutely beautiful person run payday lowest settings windowed get fps looks fantastic even lowest settings music stunning even right start game hear track grabs game sadly campaign coop dead noone plays sure get friends want play campaign someone multiplayer good xbox playstation versions game notorious everyone hack spoil game oddly pc version far easier cheat barely see cheaters general multiplayer well alive still lot players day good multiplayer entertaining amusing playthrough online last certainly least arcadestyle nazi zombies mode one best modes ever added video game would believe added last minute zombies mode call duty black ops flawless extra money contains waw maps remastered still incredibly fun ask friend play zombies usually accept overall excellent game one definitely steam library dont get full price old game paying plain stupid

We've also added .stl import and an updated windowing system. Much of this update is internal code optimization to pave the way for future updates.

"The classic Counter-Strike 1.6 is simply the best, most perfect FPS ever made. Whether you play it competitively or just pub, this game is endless fun. In terms of competition, it set the standard. With immacuately designed maps that are still being used in competitive play 11 years later, there's a reason the game is still played in mass. It's simply a perfect 5 on 5 game. It's nonstop fun, with no ceiling on how good you can become, how far you can make it in N/A leagues such as ESEA. This game is not for those who care about graphics obviously, but simple perfection in game mechanics. You can spend countless hours deathmatching, pubbing, or pugging in ESEA systems. 'Scrimming' is where it's at for me. I can't get enough and I can't seem to stop coming back to this game, even though I've been playing it since beta 5.2.

"And on the third day, Jesus was ressurectted , he first said to his friend 'Let us play some World of War to celebrate the glorious day, and praise thy of which our God, has given us.'  Call of Duty: World at War, in 2008, was the first Call of Duty game developed by now more pouplar Treyarch. Going on 7 years later, though not a rather large community, a very outspoken one. For $20, I can see where someone may be a little hesitant in paying for a game this old. That's okay, I want to convince you that it won't be a dissapointment. The multiplayer is fun, most of the hackers are long gone although every now in then you'll come to a wonky server. But for $20 all DLC is included which is quite nice. Now I'm assuming the reason you even have this game in mind is ZOMBIES. Let me tell you if you want to get this game because of zombies alone, get it. The only cautionary thing I have to say with that is, you won't really find anyone if you search :/ that will come with the age and the small(ish) community. I reccommend you dump the $20... IF you have 2-3 friends who love the game as much as you will. Custom zombies will be the most successfull kind of zombies, no if, ands, or buts. It on it's own is a extremely large community. With websites like  Zombiemodding.com  or the UGX Map Manager (that you can get at your friendy neighborhood UGX website) you will have hundreds of community made, highly detailed maps that will honestly amaze you. And if you're not feeling that, you can still play the Classics thanks to already having the DLC in game! It's a great game, it's not perfect, but one of the best Call of Duty's in a long time. If you're thinking of buying this with no core friends to play with, see on the Disscussion page for the game who'd be interested. If you're really lukcy and see it on sale, BUY IT. It will be $5-$10 and you can wait untill you find people you mutually like to have some kick-butt games with it. But if you already have friends who are encouraging you to get it. get it. End of story. Of course this is my opinion, there will always be the people who say it's the worst game to touch the planet Earth since Russian Roulette. Most of them have about 1.4 hours played. But if you look at the people who have 100+ hours played. They will all say the same thing. It was the first thing I got on steam. Haven't regretted it. If you read this whole review, My verdrict is 1337 / 10, must buy.",1,third day jesus ressurectted first said friend let us play world war celebrate glorious day praise thy god given us call duty world war first call duty game developed pouplar treyarch going years later though rather large community outspoken one see someone may little hesitant paying game old thats okay want convince wont dissapointment multiplayer fun hackers long gone although every youll come wonky server dlc included quite nice im assuming reason even game mind zombies let tell want get game zombies alone get cautionary thing say wont really find anyone search come age smallish community reccommend dump friends love game much custom zombies successfull kind zombies ands buts extremely large community websites like zombiemoddingcom ugx map manager get friendy neighborhood ugx website hundreds community made highly detailed maps honestly amaze youre feeling still play classics thanks already dlc game great game perfect one best call dutys long time youre thinking buying core friends play see disscussion page game whod interested youre really lukcy see sale buy wait untill find people mutually like kickbutt games already friends encouraging get get end story course opinion always people say worst game touch planet earth since russian roulette hours played look people hours played say thing first thing got steam havent regretted read whole review verdrict must buy

"First of all, let me start by saying this game used to be my religion 10 years ago, so I am probably biased.  So many years after its inception, the graphics for Counter-Strike do look pretty dated. of Compared to the quality standards of most of today's shooters, the original Counter-Strike (and likely its predecessors, which very much live in the same vein) may feel a bit rough, unpolished or even at times a bit corny (hostage sounds :p). Still, at it's core, the game is a fast-paced, trigger-reflex shooter.  Edit: I forgot to also include that you can use 'high definition' skins, textures and remodels for pretty much all assets in the game, so the game does have some degree of leeway and customization visually. Back in the day that was one of the things that made this game the bees knees for me. Swapped out my in-game AUG with the model and txt information an LA80, hell yeah! Not a fan of desert eagles? How does a .44 magnum revolver give you the feels? You can also edit the sound files. I remember downloading some sound pack that made Rob Zombie's Dragula play as the round start sound effect and it was almost a month until I finally changed it, to the point where now, 10 years later, I still expect to hear Dragula when I play Counter-strike. These are the things that make me feel nostalgic and think of the late 90s and early 2000; they became iconic for me.   This game is all about making your shots count before the other guy gets his in. Deaths come quickly, wins feel rewarding. The games are split up into objective-based perma-death rounds. If you are a terrorist, you may have to plant a bomb (edgy, I know, but remember how old this game is- concepts came way before 9/11 and the explosion of modern terrorism, etc) and if you found yourself on the Counter-terrorist team, your objective would be to find and secure or disarm the bomb before it's detonated. Each round can also be completed deathmatch style by wiping out the enemy team (indeed, this will usually happen in most cases as each team pushes towards their respective objective)  Occasionally, due to the respectable size and intelligent layout of the maps, there will come situations where there are only one or two players left alive on each team and both teams must aggressively pursue the objective. You've never experienced tension until you have 40 seconds to defuse a bomb and you don't know where the devil who planted it went. You attempt to disarm it while there's still time. You hear footsteps behind you. Your hair trigger reflexes can save you. Will you come out on top?  There are still hundreds, maybe thousands of public Counter strike servers available, and a good number of players to populate them (though many servers are ghost or bot servers also). Most of them (95%) will run some sort of addons and plugins but they install automatically on the fly as needed on your client so you dont have to worry about extra downloads. These addons will range from subtle things that enhance game functions like realtime stats, to comical sound effects (I've heard the 'HEAD SHOT!' callout from Unreal Tournament in CS more than I have from playing any UT game) to absolutely ridiculous and gamechanging, to the leveling Warcraft 3 hero addon where you can get a chain lightning spell XD to being able to deploy a parachute whenever you want to to avoid any fall damage.  It is a bit old, so if that word alone scares you you may want to avoid the original CS (and possibly the newer ones as well, as they play very similarly) but if you enjoyed the Half-Life series (the engine) and you like modern shooters and want to try one with some good pace, try Counter-Strike. Where a game of Call of Duty or the like would typically degenerate into a full on bloodbath where nothing is sacred and everyone is shooting you from behind, Counter Strike has pacing; every round can play out completely different from the last, depending on the tactics used by each team and the route they choose to take towards their objective.   It's far from perfect, but it will always have a special place in my heart. &lt;3  There was a time, when, if you wanted to flashbang your team and hear their cries of anguish, this was pretty much the only game you could do it in.  10/10 for flashbang memories",1,first let start saying game used religion years ago probably biased many years inception graphics counterstrike look pretty dated compared quality standards todays shooters original counterstrike likely predecessors much live vein may feel bit rough unpolished even times bit corny hostage sounds p still core game fastpaced triggerreflex shooter edit forgot also include use high definition skins textures remodels pretty much assets game game degree leeway customization visually back day one things made game bees knees swapped ingame aug model txt information la hell yeah fan desert eagles magnum revolver give feels also edit sound files remember downloading sound pack made rob zombies dragula play round start sound effect almost month finally changed point years later still expect hear dragula play counterstrike things make feel nostalgic think late early became iconic game making shots count guy gets deaths come quickly wins feel rewarding games split objectivebased permadeath rounds terrorist may plant bomb edgy know remember old game concepts came way explosion modern terrorism etc found counterterrorist team objective would find secure disarm bomb detonated round also completed deathmatch style wiping enemy team indeed usually happen cases team pushes towards respective objective occasionally due respectable size intelligent layout maps come situations one two players left alive team teams must aggressively pursue objective youve never experienced tension seconds defuse bomb dont know devil planted went attempt disarm theres still time hear footsteps behind hair trigger reflexes save come top still hundreds maybe thousands public counter strike servers available good number players populate though many servers ghost bot servers also run sort addons plugins install automatically fly needed client dont worry extra downloads addons range subtle things enhance game functions like realtime stats comical sound effects ive heard head shot callout unreal tournament cs playing ut game absolutely ridiculous gamechanging leveling warcraft hero addon get chain lightning spell xd able deploy parachute whenever want avoid fall damage bit old word alone scares may want avoid original cs possibly newer ones well play similarly enjoyed halflife series engine like modern shooters want try one good pace try counterstrike game call duty like would typically degenerate full bloodbath nothing sacred everyone shooting behind counter strike pacing every round play completely different last depending tactics used team route choose take towards objective far perfect always special place heart lt time wanted flashbang team hear cries anguish pretty much game could flashbang memories

"The game is perfectly designed and its graphics is incredible. The Counter Strike 1.6 game is specifically designed to offer shear fun and excitement for all young and old generation as well. The game tactics cannot be judged at ease as the targets and tasks change as per the assigned map location inside the game. In this game, the real challenges are like exploiting the opposition, diffusing the bomb, killing enemy with mere knife as a weapon and rescuing the hostages which are trapped at the weird locations. All in all, the tasks assigned in this game are never achievable in a time span of 5 minutes.  In some map of this game, the task is to win the round within 90 seconds which is quite impossible if you are playing the expert level. Also some of the team members don't follow your commands during the game which adds more delay in achieving the tasks. In such situations one has to have the accurate skills to win this game. So it is obvious that this game will take near about 2 months time to complete all the four modes like easy, normal, hard and expert. But if you love this game, and there is proper audio settings present at your machine, then there is no stopping and all modes of this game can be completed within few days or may be in few hours of time. Now in terms of speculation, it is seen that parents worry about their child playing offensive games and counter strike 1.6 is no excuse to this scenario. So children's should keep in mind that playing such games is for fun and they must themselves have control over the time which they devote towards this popular and addictive game.   The game is full of action and I feel that one who plays a counter strike game can perform the tasks like studying and other home related duties at a greater pace. But it is necessary that the gamers spend a lot of time on studying since balance between games and study has to be maintained at any cost. So the students who play this game should take care of home duties and study at first. At last if they find time, they have to invest it while playing this incredible game.",1,game perfectly designed graphics incredible counter strike game specifically designed offer shear fun excitement young old generation well game tactics cannot judged ease targets tasks change per assigned map location inside game game real challenges like exploiting opposition diffusing bomb killing enemy mere knife weapon rescuing hostages trapped weird locations tasks assigned game never achievable time span minutes map game task win round within seconds quite impossible playing expert level also team members dont follow commands game adds delay achieving tasks situations one accurate skills win game obvious game take near months time complete four modes like easy normal hard expert love game proper audio settings present machine stopping modes game completed within days may hours time terms speculation seen parents worry child playing offensive games counter strike excuse scenario childrens keep mind playing games fun must control time devote towards popular addictive game game full action feel one plays counter strike game perform tasks like studying home related duties greater pace necessary gamers spend lot time studying since balance games study maintained cost students play game take care home duties study first last find time invest playing incredible game

"Counter-Strike is only available to play in multiplayer; no bots. So you're forced to connect to someone else's server and put up with randomness and repetitive maps. And of course, it's the GoldSource Engine and all that entails.  Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is considerably more fun, in my opinion. You get all the same weapons, but there's a pseudo-story mode, AI bots to play with, and different objectives and a variety of maps you hop around, all of them challenging you in new ways. Kind of like the current campaign contracts in Global Offensive and Team Fortress 2.  Get this game (package), especially if it's on sale.

"After playing countless hours on Black Ops II, I wanted to relax and play some old school WaW zombies. Came with every zombie map in WaW. Zombies was really fun. I got to use the old World War II weapons on zombies, and people weren't lying when they said that World At War is probably the bloodiest and goriest CoD out on the market today. If only the Multiplayer servers weren't hacked and modded, I could have some actual fun playing multiplayer using WWII weaponry. There is literally ZERO vanilla servers, and it literally feels like I'm looking for a server in Garry's Mod.  I'll give this game a 6/10 due to multiplayer being terrible, but zombies are about the only thing you want to get this game for, unless you want to play on a modded/hacked server. Definitely not worth $19.99, or even $14.99, but probably like $9.99, which is when it is 50% off.",-1,playing countless hours black ops ii wanted relax play old school waw zombies came every zombie map waw zombies really fun got use old world war ii weapons zombies people werent lying said world war probably bloodiest goriest cod market today multiplayer servers werent hacked modded could actual fun playing multiplayer using wwii weaponry literally zero vanilla servers literally feels like im looking server garrys mod ill give game due multiplayer terrible zombies thing want get game unless want play moddedhacked server definitely worth even probably like

"Without a doubt this game being about 7-8 years old still probably my favorite Call of Duty of all time! OP guns were limited to 1-2 that I can think of. Campaign had a great story line but I still think the original Modern Warfare had the best campaign but this is a VERY close second. Multiplayer was great and might still be (IDK dont really play mp) But best thing are the zombies. In my personal opinion nothing better than to sit in a lobby with a few friends and just blast zombies away for hours seeing how high of a round you can get up to. Wiether its the 4 original maps (Nacht de Untoten, Verruckt, Shi No Numa, or Der Riese) or the hundreds to probably thousands of custom maps you can easily download and install. My recomendation if you do play zombies is to download 'Tunngle' its a software that allows you to connect to a simulated LAN connection to be able to make it easier for everyone to join the coop lobby you and your friends make. All you have to do is make an account and then go to the lobby called 'Call of Duty World at War Coop zombies' or something like that. And have your friends make accounts as well, its free and way easier to connect everyone together in the same lobby no matter where you are. That is really the only thing this game lags is Coop connection sucks majorly! But if you use Tunngle it should be MUCH easier to work with. Even for 20$ now to have tons of maps to go and play its worth it guys (and girls). So go download this game and start having some fun expecially the zombies part! Also can add me on steam love to find people to play zombies with.",1,without doubt game years old still probably favorite call duty time op guns limited think campaign great story line still think original modern warfare best campaign close second multiplayer great might still idk dont really play mp best thing zombies personal opinion nothing better sit lobby friends blast zombies away hours seeing high round get wiether original maps nacht de untoten verruckt shi numa der riese hundreds probably thousands custom maps easily download install recomendation play zombies download tunngle software allows connect simulated lan connection able make easier everyone join coop lobby friends make make account go lobby called call duty world war coop zombies something like friends make accounts well free way easier connect everyone together lobby matter really thing game lags coop connection sucks majorly use tunngle much easier work even tons maps go play worth guys girls go download game start fun expecially zombies part also add steam love find people play zombies

It is The Wizard of Oz of first-person shooters - a true classic and must-play for any fan of the genre and videogames in general.  While the graphics may be dated by 2016 standards, this means even a very old computer can run it without a hitch, and the great gameplay ultimately trumps everything else.

"You REALLY need to be a fan of CoD's mechanical horse hockey if you're gonna lay 20 bucks down on this.  Respawning enemies that kill you in 2 hits.  Turtle's pace movement speed and the sticky, doesnt-stop-when-you-need-it sprinting.  The guns are nice and historically boring, even if a little too close to the screen.   Controller support is lousy, surprising for a console port. If it had straight up no-hassle 360 controller support I would'nt be complaining, and I'd still have this installed. You can force it to read your input via a console command but there's no vibration, rendering it pointless, if you ask me.  The russian campaign and zombie mode are the best this thing has to offer.  For everything else? You need a high tolerance for bull ♥♥♥♥ and your own time going in a hole.  The multiplayer CAN be fun. wasn't for me. you might even enjoy the pacific theatre levels of the campaign.

"This game is without a doubt an arcady first person shooter, just like Call of Duty is know to be. Simple mechanics, decent graphics, and semi accurate story (im not sure the characters in-game actually exsisted), and hey! The first Zombie mode (all WaW DLC maps included). Unfortunatly the ports to the pc arent always good and ive had multiple problems with this game since i bought it (2 years ago). for starters there are a few wierd problems with intel socket GPUs, i would not use it with them since there is a wierd slow down/ speed up when fps goes up and down like a yoyo (This might be different with the newer ones, since i used an intel HD 3000 with 6gb of 1333 sys ram. partly because the iris pro operates with a small amount of ESram, i suppose a ram upgrade would suffice.) But it seems to work with an FX 4100 with 8gb sys ram and a 2gb GTX 660 SC (super clocked).  Now last time i checked the multiplayer was almost empty, since the nature of call of duty is everybody moves to the next game and starts again. and MW2 was incredibly popular. So its hard to find a game online. Not to mention the majority are modded and i expect there are plenty of hackers waiting to prey on your patience, althought it would be completely usless for them.  Since this is the game that brought in the idea of zombie survival, there isnt much too it, compared to BO1/2. Border up windows get money kill zombies that get in, get money, buy new guns, kill more zombies. yadayadayda. Its the mode at its infancy and dont expect the full blown mode it is today.  In hindsight i would not have bought it. But hey! this is to help you guys/girls to decide. But it is my opinion, everyone is different. although the multiplayer being almost empty is a fact.   thanks and have fun!",-1,game without doubt arcady first person shooter like call duty know simple mechanics decent graphics semi accurate story im sure characters ingame actually exsisted hey first zombie mode waw dlc maps included unfortunatly ports pc arent always good ive multiple problems game since bought years ago starters wierd problems intel socket gpus would use since wierd slow speed fps goes like yoyo might different newer ones since used intel hd gb sys ram partly iris pro operates small amount esram suppose ram upgrade would suffice seems work fx gb sys ram gb gtx sc super clocked last time checked multiplayer almost empty since nature call duty everybody moves next game starts mw incredibly popular hard find game online mention majority modded expect plenty hackers waiting prey patience althought would completely usless since game brought idea zombie survival isnt much compared bo border windows get money kill zombies get get money buy new guns kill zombies yadayadayda mode infancy dont expect full blown mode today hindsight would bought hey help guysgirls decide opinion everyone different although multiplayer almost empty fact thanks fun

"Never before has a multiplayer game blended all the elements of true competition and sweat-soaked-shirt anxiety as well a Counter-Strike (CS). You probably already know CS as one of the most popular modifications for Half-Life. It's been available for download for over a year, at least in beta form. But unless you've got a super fast Internet connection at your house, you may not have played it yet as the nearly 100 megabyte download may be daunting for those of you not fortunate enough to have a high-speed connection. Thankfully CS has turned into a full-blown retail game and, while the two versions of CS are identical, it certainly worth shelling out $10 for this stellar title...plus you get a few more multiplayer goodies in the retail package to boot.  Let me start off by saying that the Counter-Strike pack is a stand-alone product. You don't need the original Half-Life to play this game. In the retail package you get a full version of CS as well as Team Fortress Classic, Opposing Force multiplayer, and the Wanted, Redemption and Firearms mods. The entire pack is overflowing with multiplayer fun, but, of course, the real focus of the retail release is Counter-Strike.  There is a single-player component to CS and, while it provides a good primer, this mod is all about online action. You basically play a game of cat and mouse, with the mouse being a terrorist group and the cat a squad of counter-terrorists. As a terrorist, you're goal is to plant a bomb at a specific location or hold a group of hostages. As a counter-terrorist, it's your duty to defuse said bomb or rescue the ill-fated hostages. Taking out all players on the opposing side will also assure your victory.  CS is an action lover's dream, with games lasting only four or five minutes (if that in some cases) because, unlike Half-Life, one shot to the head can mean instant death. CS is the perfect mix between fast-action and realistic damage. You can't just absorb bullet after bullet and expect to walk away. Working as a team is a must and, while you're in the game, taking the lone wolf approach will often get you killed...and fast.  It's the team-based tactics that make CS so fun. I can't stress how important it is in this game to act as a team. If your team is on the defensive side you'll all benefit by creating a cohesive strategy. If you team is on the offensive side, you will all benefit by sticking closely together as well. I'm sure you've seen movies or television show demonstrating this 'Conga Line' style of infiltration. Well, that's exactly how your team will have to act. This creates a fantastic game balance that will keep you coming back for more. It'll also keep you from thinking about your school work, your job, and interaction with your loved ones, and often work around the IGN offices will be put on hold so we can clog our network with CS.  Visually the game will not disappoint. While the Half-Life engine isn't the prettiest beast out there, there is plenty of animation that creates a smooth look and feel, and the gun models are some of the most realistic looking of any shooter available. The environmental textures look realistic enough and complement the provided camouflage well enough for you to be hidden, but not be invisible. As in real life, the distinguishable difference between good guy and bad guy is a little difficult, but the balance to this is if you can't tell who it is then you probably won't be able to hit him with your gun. Now, if you've purchased sniper rifle, you should have plenty of scope magnification to tell the difference between terrorist or counter-terrorist, but otherwise you may be taking out a team member from afar.  As good as it is, a couple of features of this game really stood out as frustrating... at first. But over a period of time they actually became enhancements to online multiplayer gaming. One feature is buying your weapons at the start of each round. This takes a little getting used to at first since, in most shooters, you just run around picking up weapons at your heart's content. Usually by the time you figured out which guns, grenades, and armor you were going to take in your early games, the bad guys would come over and kill you. But a couple of tries later, after getting the gist of things, you're off in no time. The other feature that took some getting used to was the 'wait and watch' feature after you get killed. Once you sustain a lethal injury, you have to wait for the next round to start before you can join in again -- you don't just spawn again and start shooting. This actually adds a ton of anxiety to your efforts of staying alive and completing your objective. But like I mentioned before, the rounds are short, so you shouldn't have to wait too long before you can jump in the action again.  Not surprisingly, the user interface is very Half-Life-esque. Gamers who have played Half-Life or any of the other mods for the game will have no trouble with the menu system. Even for the first time user the interface is easy to use or fumble through. The only thing that even slightly tripped us up in the interface is the 'Update' on the server page. First-time users may be confused into thinking this meant update my version of CS. Not true, it actually means update the list of game servers. But the rest of the interface is easy to understand and even easier to navigate.  Just about the only aspect of this game that we could make negative comments about is the sound. Sure, the realistic guns sounds are spot on, we just wish the same amount of attention to detail was given to the rest of the sound in the game. Some levels have lighting and thunder. When the thunder crashes it sounds a little wimpy. We were hoping for some deeper bass and clearer sounding claps from the lightning. In most of the level the user can go inside or out side of buildings, the sound of their footsteps should also change to reflect what type of surface they are walking on. The sound of footsteps getting closer and closer could also have been improved. As it stands now, it's hard to tell how far down the hallway or street a bad guy is from you by sound alone.  So how long does the magic last? Well we've been playing this game for over a year now and we still can't get enough of it. Are we tired of it? Hell no! We're still surprised by how fun this game is. This game actually made some of us squeal like little school-girls after getting sniped from an unexpected angle on high. On the other hand some of us were drawn to stand up and scream obscenities at the monitor. I guess we'll just have to get them next time!

Zombies I did not like since I do not like CoD zombies, multiplayer i never tried due to servers being empty, that leave me to say this underrated game may be the best in the whole series, which i doubt since MW2, MW3, BO, BOII and the upcoming Ghosts.

THIS GAME RUINED MY LIFE!,1,game ruined life
"Well, what can I say about this game? I can start off by saying that it is the most   outstanding brilliant   game modded! Being a modded game may sound bad but it does come with its advantages!  Main advantage:   Modded Zombies.   People mainly buy this game mostly for the zombies purely because the multiplayer servers for CoD: WAW is pretty much dead, everyone plays the later instalments of CoD but if you're a true zombie player like yoteslaya or yamimash, then you will love this game. This game has the standard campaign and when you finish that, you will unlock a game mode called Zombies. Zombies is a game mode where you will receive an endless amount of zombies going up in waves. E.g. wave 1: 8 zombies, wave 2: 14 zombies and so on.  Because this game is quite dated, it is easily modded and most of the modders live on a site called     www.zombiemodding.com   There are hundreds of zombies maps designed for CoD: WAW zombie players, modded to the extreme as they include;    Custom Zombie maps designed by the community, not any standard zombies map    Guns are ported across from MW1/MW2/MW3/Black ops 1/2 and maybe some AW guns in the future!    Player models can be changed for example, in some WAW maps you can play as some of the characters from Black ops 1: Call of the Dead    The list just goes on!   Second Advantage: It's not even that hard to download modded zombie maps, on the website  www.zombiemodding.com  they simply ask you to download an .exe file which will install the zombie maps in the directory C:\Users\&lt;YOUR COMPUTER NAME&gt; \AppData\Local\activision\codwaw\mods. If you even wanted to design your own zombie map, it takes about a few days to learn how to do it and a good couple of weeks to finish of a piece of well-designed work. Not much code involved.       How do i play these maps?       http://store.steampowered.com  You have to click the 'MODS' option which will bring up a list of your installed maps.   url=store.steampowered.com ]  http://i.imgur.com/dralY4T.jpg  [/url]      Google chrome says these modded maps from zombie modding are malicious?      I am not quite sure why google chrome says these maps are malicious, probably because they are .exe files. Don't worry, if you download them from zombie modding then they should be virus free, if not report them on the website.   Thank you for reading my review, if it's any good thumbs up so others can see.",1,well say game start saying outstanding brilliant game modded modded game may sound bad come advantages main advantage modded zombies people mainly buy game mostly zombies purely multiplayer servers cod waw pretty much dead everyone plays later instalments cod youre true zombie player like yoteslaya yamimash love game game standard campaign finish unlock game mode called zombies zombies game mode receive endless amount zombies going waves eg wave zombies wave zombies game quite dated easily modded modders live site called wwwzombiemoddingcom hundreds zombies maps designed cod waw zombie players modded extreme include custom zombie maps designed community standard zombies map guns ported across mwmwmwblack ops maybe aw guns future player models changed example waw maps play characters black ops call dead list goes second advantage even hard download modded zombie maps website wwwzombiemoddingcom simply ask download exe file install zombie maps directory cusersltyour computer namegt appdatalocalactivisioncodwawmods even wanted design zombie map takes days learn good couple weeks finish piece welldesigned work much code involved play maps httpstoresteampoweredcom click mods option bring list installed maps urlstoresteampoweredcom httpiimgurcomdralytjpg url google chrome says modded maps zombie modding malicious quite sure google chrome says maps malicious probably exe files dont worry download zombie modding virus free report website thank reading review good thumbs others see

"The origin of addiction... One of the most fun games I've had the pleasure of enjoying and the one who threw me to the vibrant world of FPS, my favorite genre 'til this day. Now, important information: do not be fooled by the amount of hours marked by Steam. There, when the beta versions were launched in 1999, when the game was free. Then 1.6 was launched until about 4 years ago, I had it in a different account, which I do not own anymore. Over a decade of gaming, several hours every day, which certainly have accumulated thousands of hours. By far the most played game throughout my life... You see, the first sentence that illustrates this review was not chosen at random. I had to stop playing completely, cold turkey, or I would fail high school. Just decided to buy it again and play for nostalgia sake. I'm not afraid, I'm much more self controlled now and the fact that I'm not even half as good as before, kinda takes away the compulsion to play. By far the longest relationship I have ever had and we are getting back together... this is a good day.",1,origin addiction one fun games ive pleasure enjoying one threw vibrant world fps favorite genre til day important information fooled amount hours marked steam beta versions launched game free launched years ago different account anymore decade gaming several hours every day certainly accumulated thousands hours far played game throughout life see first sentence illustrates review chosen random stop playing completely cold turkey would fail high school decided buy play nostalgia sake im afraid im much self controlled fact im even half good kinda takes away compulsion play far longest relationship ever getting back together good day

"When I got this game, damn was I surprised! I played the first mission, and even though I got owned, I was having fun. Zombies is cool, too. Then, I went to the big mothertrucker of the game, Muiltiplayer. I looked through the server browser and couldn't find any Vanilla servers with players, so I settled for getting a Bots mod. And guess what? I had fun. The bots were difficult, but I still fought back. I even found a near perfect loadout right off the bat. The Light Gunner was great, since it had my favorite SMG of all-time, the Thompson. So, I used that until level 5, where I made the same loadout with some perk changes. Overall, really fun game, and almost a breath of fresh air from the bland (newer) COD games. It is based on WW2 (something I think we should forget) but that helps it. Its graphics are kinda outdated by todays COD and other FPS stadards, but I like it even more cause of that. 7.8/10",1,got game damn surprised played first mission even though got owned fun zombies cool went big mothertrucker game muiltiplayer looked server browser couldnt find vanilla servers players settled getting bots mod guess fun bots difficult still fought back even found near perfect loadout right bat light gunner great since favorite smg alltime thompson used level made loadout perk changes overall really fun game almost breath fresh air bland newer cod games based ww something think forget helps graphics kinda outdated todays cod fps stadards like even cause

"I have a deep hatred of Call of Duty (for a wide array of reasons), but this game on the PC kind of passed my firewall.  In terms of system requirements and gameplay fluency, I was beyond surprised with how well this game runs. I was running a full 60 FPS flawless, even on the higher-paced Zombies mod, which honestly is the only saving grace in Call of Duty.  The singleplayer was pretty interesting, too; it was a cool campaign of WWII taking place on two fronts against two highly different enemies - the Japanese favor unconventional, barbaric and suicidal attacks which provide challenge for the close-quarters-oriented United States Marines, and Hitler's Angels go against the Soviets in a longer-ranged conflict.  The weaponry feels so unique and abstract from other installments of this otherwise putrid franchise, though that primarily comes from the gore effects in this game. Watching enemies' limbs go flying off when I blast them off with a pump-action shotgun reminds me of many years ago when I played this game on the Xbox 360.  So World at War provides an entertaining singleplayer, which also has the equivalent of Halo's 'skulls' (difficulty and game modifiers that provide either more challenging or easier effects in the gameplay) and cooperative campaign gameplay (it did on the Xbox, at least; I'm almost positive it does on the PC), and the Zombies mode is at its strongest and purest roots. It's tragic when the series' (Zombies) origins are the best version of it.  Oh, and it's World War II, not this futuristic Titanfall wannabe ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. (One of my many reasons for loathing CoD.)",1,deep hatred call duty wide array reasons game pc kind passed firewall terms system requirements gameplay fluency beyond surprised well game runs running full fps flawless even higherpaced zombies mod honestly saving grace call duty singleplayer pretty interesting cool campaign wwii taking place two fronts two highly different enemies japanese favor unconventional barbaric suicidal attacks provide challenge closequartersoriented united states marines hitlers angels go soviets longerranged conflict weaponry feels unique abstract installments otherwise putrid franchise though primarily comes gore effects game watching enemies limbs go flying blast pumpaction shotgun reminds many years ago played game xbox world war provides entertaining singleplayer also equivalent halos skulls difficulty game modifiers provide either challenging easier effects gameplay cooperative campaign gameplay xbox least im almost positive pc zombies mode strongest purest roots tragic series zombies origins best version oh world war ii futuristic titanfall wannabe one many reasons loathing cod

"The actuall multiplayer for the game is still pretty strong, and the servers that are hosted by different demains and services allow a safe and secure multiplayer for those who are still wanting to play this for its online pvp action.  However, i can see in your eyes that the main reason you are wanting to get the game is either for the single player / co-op campain and obviously the zombies.   The campain for the game is very good as you play as multiple people from different nations during world war 2, and the story can be challenging and sometimes thrilling. Also lets not forget that the game has 4 player co-op throughout the whole campain so you and your friends can have fun together.  But the zombies is the main attraction for the game. And there is only one way to describe it.. awesome, the maps are unique and the charictors that you play have some really good voice acting.   But even better is that here on gods number one platform, is the custom maps and mods for the game, thats right well over 1000 custom maps for the zombies and online multiplayer, and don't worry, your friends can come along as well. ;)  Do i recommend the game?  Absolutely, especially as the game is also very easy to run, so even the low budget or low performance laptops can run the game at 60fps.  92/100",1,actuall multiplayer game still pretty strong servers hosted different demains services allow safe secure multiplayer still wanting play online pvp action however see eyes main reason wanting get game either single player coop campain obviously zombies campain game good play multiple people different nations world war story challenging sometimes thrilling also lets forget game player coop throughout whole campain friends fun together zombies main attraction game one way describe awesome maps unique charictors play really good voice acting even better gods number one platform custom maps mods game thats right well custom maps zombies online multiplayer dont worry friends come along well recommend game absolutely especially game also easy run even low budget low performance laptops run game fps

"Synopsis  Born in Austria in 1889, Adolf Hitler rose to power in German politics as leader of the National Socialist German Workers Party, also known as the Nazi Party. Hitler was chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and served as dictator from 1934 to 1945. His policies precipitated World War II and the Holocaust. Hitler committed suicide with wife Eva Braun on April 30, 1945, in his Berlin bunker.  Early Years  Dictator Adolf Hitler was born in Braunau am Inn, Austria, on April 20, 1889, and was the fourth of six children born to Alois Hitler and Klara Polzl. When Hitler was 3 years old, the family moved from Austria to Germany. As a child, Hitler clashed frequently with his father. Following the death of his younger brother, Edmund, in 1900, he became detached and introverted. His father did not approve of his interest in fine art rather than business. In addition to art, Hitler showed an early interest in German nationalism, rejecting the authority of Austria-Hungary. This nationalism would become the motivating force of Hitler's life.  Alois died suddenly in 1903. Two years later, Adolf's mother allowed her son to drop out of school. He moved to Vienna and worked as a casual laborer and a watercolor painter. Hitler applied to the Academy of Fine Arts twice, and was rejected both times. Out of money, he moved into a homeless shelter, where he remained for several years. Hitler later pointed to these years as the time when he first cultivated his anti-Semitism, though there is some debate about this account.  At the outbreak of World War I, Hitler applied to serve in the German army. He was accepted in August 1914, though he was still an Austrian citizen. Although he spent much of his time away from the front lines, Hitler was present at a number of significant battles and was wounded at the Somme. He was decorated for bravery, receiving the Iron Cross First Class and the Black Wound Badge.  3 GALLERY 3 Images Hitler became embittered over the collapse of the war effort. The experience reinforced his passionate German patriotism, and he was shocked by Germany's surrender in 1918. Like other German nationalists, he believed that the German army had been betrayed by civilian leaders and Marxists. He found the Treaty of Versailles degrading, particularly the demilitarization of the Rhineland and the stipulation that Germany accept responsibility for starting the war.  After World War I, Hitler returned to Munich and continued to work for the military as an intelligence officer. While monitoring the activities of the German Workers’ Party (DAP), Hitler adopted many of the anti-Semitic, nationalist and anti-Marxist ideas of DAP founder Anton Drexler. Drexler invited Hitler to join the DAP, which he did in 1919.  To increase its appeal, the DAP changed its name to the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP). Hitler personally designed the party banner, featuring a swastika in a white circle on a red background. Hitler soon gained notoriety for his vitriolic speeches against the Treaty of Versailles, rival politicians, Marxists and Jews. In 1921, Hitler replaced Drexler as NSDAP party chairman.  Hitler's vitriolic beer-hall speeches began attracting regular audiences. Early followers included army captain Ernst Rohm, the head of the Nazi paramilitary organization, the Sturmabteilung (SA), which protected meetings and frequently attacked political opponents.  On November 8, 1923, Hitler and the SA stormed a public meeting of 3,000 people at a large beer hall in Munich. Hitler announced that the national revolution had begun and declared the formation of a new government. After a short struggle including 20 deaths, the coup, known as the 'Beer Hall Putsch,' failed.  Hitler was arrested three days later and tried for high treason. He served a year in prison, during which time he dictated most of the first volume of Mein Kampf ('My Struggle') to his deputy, Rudolf Hess. The book laid out Hitler's plans for transforming German society into one based on race.  Rise to Power  The Great Depression in Germany provided a political opportunity for Hitler. Germans were ambivalent to the parliamentary republic and increasingly open to extremist options. In 1932, Hitler ran against Paul von Hindenburg for the presidency. Hitler came in second in both rounds of the election, garnering more than 35 percent of the vote in the final election. The election established Hitler as a strong force in German politics. Hindenburg reluctantly agreed to appoint Hitler as chancellor in order to promote political balance.  Hitler used his position as chancellor to form a de facto legal dictatorship. The Reichstag Fire Decree, announced after a suspicious fire at the Reichstag, suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial. Hitler also engineered the passage of the Enabling Act, which gave his cabinet full legislative powers for a period of four years and allowed deviations from the constitution.  Having achieved full control over the legislative and executive branches of government, Hitler and his political allies embarked on a systematic suppression of the remaining political opposition. By the end of June, the other parties had been intimidated into disbanding. On July 14, 1933, Hitler's Nazi Party was declared the only legal political party in Germany.  Military opposition was also punished. The demands of the SA for more political and military power led to the Night of the Long Knives, which took place from June 30 to July 2, 1934. Ernst Röhm and other SA leaders, along with a number of Hitler's political enemies, were rounded up and shot.  The day before Hindenburg's death in August 1934, the cabinet had enacted a law abolishing the office of president and combining its powers with those of the chancellor. Hitler thus became head of state as well as head of government, and was formally named as leader and chancellor. As head of state, Hitler became supreme commander of the armed forces. He began to mobilize for war. Germany withdrew from the League of Nations, and Hitler announced a massive expansion of Germany’s armed forces.  The Nazi regime also included social reform measures. Hitler promoted anti-smoking campaigns across the country. These campaigns stemmed from Hitler's self-imposed dietary restrictions, which included abstinence from alcohol and meat. At dinners, Hitler sometimes told graphic stories about the slaughter of animals in an effort to shame his fellow diners. He encouraged all Germans to keep their bodies pure of any intoxicating or unclean substance.  A main Nazi concept was the notion of racial hygiene. New laws banned marriage between non-Jewish and Jewish Germans, and deprived 'non-Aryans' of the benefits of German citizenship. Hitler's early eugenic policies targeted children with physical and developmental disabilities, and later authorized a euthanasia program for disabled adults.  The Holocaust was also conducted under the auspices of racial hygiene. Between 1939 and 1945, Nazis and their collaborators were responsible for the deaths of 11 million to 14 million people, including about 6 million Jews, representing two-thirds of the Jewish population in Europe. Deaths took place in concentration and extermination camps and through mass executions. Other persecuted groups included Poles, communists, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses and trade unionists, among others. Hitler probably never visited the concentration camps and did not speak publicly about the killings.  World War II  In 1938Hitler, along with several other European leaders, signed the Munich Agreement. The treaty ceded the Sudetenland districts to Germany, reversing part of the Versailles Treaty. As a result of the summit, Hitler was named Time magazine's Man of the Year for 1938. This diplomatic win only whetted his appetite for a renewed German dominance. On September 1, Germany invaded Poland. In response, Britain and France declared war on Germany",1,synopsis born austria adolf hitler rose power german politics leader national socialist german workers party also known nazi party hitler

Actually you have a very 'strict' line on the story map, if you'll try to go to somewhere you will just hit an invisible wall or some other stupid barrier (a small tree branch for example - an object which will stop you from proceeding).

"Holy @#$% this games zombies  Zombies is literrally the only reason why I am interested in CoD anymore period, and this game being the original zombies game is the best or equal to Bo2 in my own opinion. Zombies is the main reason to buy this game wether your into the modding community or the plain original maps like me. I've always found that zombies is the most deep and engaging aspect of the CoD franchise because of all the different ways to play and stradegies you form. Zombies are much more zombie like in this game, I feel, because well.......their stupid!.  Example  'Oh! I had a lot of trouble here so mabye I should wait until round 4 then go their then i will be able to buy the next door!'  The modding community is MASSIVE AND I MEAN MASSIVE and you could literally have 100x the number of hours you did with the base game.   HOWEVER  The matchmaking system is HORRIBLE and you will wait around for possibly an hour or more refreshing and waiting to find a match. Also it can get very annoying when you want to have a legit online run and a modder ruins that fun and just makes everything fun in their eyes but bland a boring in yours.  I give this game a 9/10  Lots of content with few downsides and lots of Zombies   (BTW my hours would be 4x as much if it showed my console hours.)",1,holy games zombies zombies literrally reason interested cod anymore period game original zombies game best equal bo opinion zombies main reason buy game wether modding community plain original maps like ive always found zombies deep engaging aspect cod franchise different ways play stradegies form zombies much zombie like game feel welltheir stupid example oh lot trouble mabye wait round go able buy next door modding community massive mean massive could literally x number hours base game however matchmaking system horrible wait around possibly hour refreshing waiting find match also get annoying want legit online run modder ruins fun makes everything fun eyes bland boring give game lots content downsides lots zombies btw hours would x much showed console hours
"I think World at War is definitely one of the best Call of Duty games, ever! It has an intense understanding of warfare thus unlike any other FPS it gives the players more than a regular opportunity just to match a crosshair with the enemy in front of you. Rather you feel a whole battlefield with a realistic weaponry.   Campaign is especially good considering that it tells the story of fronts that has been mentioned less so far, than the other fronts of WWII. It is not very difficult to play, like most of the CoD games, however Veteran difficulty could be tried for a fun challange. Also, you have the opportunity to play in competitive Co-op mode up to 4 players . Other than that there is of course the zombie mode which is the very beginning of the whole series. Map numbers are limited and so are the possibilities but I think it is a must for every dedicated player. Multiplayer is realistic and although perks, attachments and weapons are of great use and advantage for a player, higher levels of others is not a crucial concern for a beginner. The game depends on the talent and caution of a player mostly as well as gameplay experience but not definitely on their level.  In overall, I can say that this game is a must for a CoD player, a nice and slighlty different experience for an FPS player and a good place to start for the inexperienced action gamers.",1,think world war definitely one best call duty games ever intense understanding warfare thus unlike fps gives players regular opportunity match crosshair enemy front rather feel whole battlefield realistic weaponry campaign especially good considering tells story fronts mentioned less far fronts wwii difficult play like cod games however veteran difficulty could tried fun challange also opportunity play competitive coop mode players course zombie mode beginning whole series map numbers limited possibilities think must every dedicated player multiplayer realistic although perks attachments weapons great use advantage player higher levels others crucial concern beginner game depends talent caution player mostly well gameplay experience definitely level overall say game must cod player nice slighlty different experience fps player good place start inexperienced action gamers

"VERY MINOR SPOILER ALERT*  Absolutely amazing game with a compelling story, great graphics even in 2014, and deserving of the Title of Last Great CoD. Whether you're a fan of the series or not, this game MUST be played through and through at least once by anyone who calls theirself a 'Shooter fan'. Taking place in the conflict that shaped the second half of the 20th century, this game delivers at every angle. Be a U.S. Marine taking the fight to the Japanese Empire on the frontlines of the Pacific Theater, or a Russian sniper avenging his fallen comrades after the massacre at Stalingrad. Or, if you prefer, a hardcore, expert zombie killer stuck in various infested locations to hold out as long as you can, while discovering a secret plot by the Nazis that could have changed the course of history. 8.7 out of 10, for sure. A word of warning though: STAY AWAY FROM THE MULTIPLAYER UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING!!! Years of expertise have made those who remain in the multiplayer servers very powerful foes and it would be unwise to indulge them unless you count yourself among that crowd. Other than the age gap, this game is perfect for any FPS collection.",1,minor spoiler alert absolutely amazing game compelling story great graphics even deserving title last great cod whether youre fan series game must played least anyone calls theirself shooter fan taking place conflict shaped second half th century game delivers every angle us marine taking fight japanese empire frontlines pacific theater russian sniper avenging fallen comrades massacre stalingrad prefer hardcore expert zombie killer stuck various infested locations hold long discovering secret plot nazis could changed course history sure word warning though stay away multiplayer unless know youre years expertise made remain multiplayer servers powerful foes would unwise indulge unless count among crowd age gap game perfect fps collection

"This is the most recent WWII game in the Call Of Duty franchise, and that is a shame really. Treyarch crushed anyone's dreams of a World At War II with the announcement of Black Ops III. I'm not complaining, either. Treyarch is my favorite Call Of Duty Developers, so I would have been happy either way. This game shows its age with a severe lack of basics such as achievements, modern multiplayer weapon unlock progression systems, and my personal biggest blow, no combat training. Aside from those small complaints, the game still looks pretty nice, the story is barebones but effective, the multiplayer isn't comepletely barron, and the custom zombies is the main reason for anyone buying this game in the first place.

"This game stands tall with Call of Duty 4. It is great, and it is worth 20 dollars ALONE if you want to play the 'Nazi Zombies' mode, which comes with 4 great maps, plus you can create your own. I will warn you that this is not a user friendly editor, as you need a lot of experience with map making before you can even begin to scratch something together, but if you are dedicated enough, you can make some briliant masterpieces of maps. Multiplayer is enjoyable, although there are a lot of modded servers and 'Increased Player Cap' games, but they are fun to play in my opinion. The single player campaign's story is pretty descent, and amazingly you can play the whole singleplayer campaign with a friend for some fun infantry killing action.

"My favorite COD tied with MW1-2, Black Ops, and COD 1-2. THis game is amazing I honestly think it's underatted and just flat out amazing just like every cod since the 4th this game's campaign is practically based of and almost copied rip offs of actual hit films etc. But it's still a worthy campaign (It has one of the most critically acclaimed actors in history Gary Oldman in it!) nonetheless the real action is at the MP and newly introduced Nazi Zombies modes. The MP is amazing but compared to COD4 and every other COD probably the worst of them all due to lack of servers still running just MP and such. Also the earning weapons system is a bit of a bore and a bother at times. The game should run on almost any PC even laptops as long as it's optimized at lowest settings possible and the mods made for it are what makes this game still extremely playable in today's standards of MP gaming but if you have all DLC for Black Ops only get this game if you're either a die hard fan of the series, want to play some campaign, don't have the dlc for Black Ops, or if you just want to experience sometihng new but old compared to other games released during the years 2007-08.

I'm so sorry that there are too much cheaters on servers, but if Valve can make it better , it would be great :D Remember old good times, waiting to start a new match between Na'Vi and fNatic &lt;3 And all other teams...

I play it every day, but it isn't like sometimes. Now graphic is important. Well, it isn't. I know that this game is dead already... I want to get it back, but there is no way to do that.  Cheaters are everywhere now. In every single game. You can buy cheat for CS:GO for 5$ I think... My friend bought it. I asked him : ' Why did you bought that ? Isn't it better to enjoy playing the game without cheats? ' He told me: ' I want to beat everyone. I want to be the best. No one can stop me now. '  I don't know why are you doing it, this is beautiful game. When I played it for the first time, it was awesome :D Finally a game that I can play with my friends on LAN. And, till today, I'm playing it. I never downloaded a cheat. I don't need that. I want to learn how to play, to be the beast in the world... Now everyone is wanting money, money money... I heard about CS:GO Lounge aka CS GO betting site. Now everyone is watching matches because of skins, to get free money... Well, when I was young, in 2005. I waited with my friends a CS 1.6 match. It was beautiful. Now i sit here, and watch this CS:GO matches... So many people watch matches... But 90% watch them because of f***ing bet...  It will never be like sometimes...

"Welcome to the world’s most fun over rated pile of ♥♥♥♥.   Since I first got a PC nearly 3 years ago all I have ever heard is counter strike, counter strike, counter strike. And, after about 15 hours of play time I see why.   Right away I can see that when counter strike came out it was the magnum opus of the fps/multiplayer genre and I can respect that but that also explains the largest problem with counter strike, its nonexistent learning curve. For the first maybe 3 hours I played on a few different servers and never killed a single person. I figured I’m new to this and it seems as thoe these guys/girls have been playing much longer than I have been so I began to brush it off and then 2 hours and may servers later I had killed maybe 6 people, not much had changed. And then remembered that that’s stupid, I shouldn’t be playing against people that have 150 hours clocked while I have 5.  Another problem is the weapons  I can understand the weird names, Valve would have been a smaller company then and saved a buck by naming them weird stuff but that doesn’t mean I won’t still make fun of them. The damaged ratio is also complete ♥♥♥♥♥. The sniper rifle is a one hit kill the subs are useless and I was once hit across the map with a shot gun blast. The knife is a bit under powered but Thats better than it being a light saber. And For some reason the only guns that are ever used are the AK look alike the M16 look alike and the sniper rifle.   I should say that counter strike is not a bad a game. It's for sure a sextillion times better than any Call of Duty ever made. And I will confess that this game is more fun giving your friends ADHD kid a gram of cocaine and telling him his dad is made of candy. But it’s also as frustrating as trying to put that same kid in a car seat.

"This is arguably the best Call of Duty game in the entire franchise. There is nothing bad about this game, through countless hours of playing this amazing game, I can tell you that this is one of the best investments of 20$ I have ever made in my life. To begin, the singleplayer campaign has an excellent atmosphere making you feel as if you were fighting in the midst of World War II yourself. The architecture of the maps are great and combine excellent story telling with compelling visuals and a fair challenge. The campaign is rather long too, for a Call of Duty title. I't took me about a week to finish the entire campaign. And another excellent addition is the death cards you can use in Co-op. It gives you another reason to dust off the campaign and search for the death cards scattered throughout the maps. The multiplayer is also equally as good. There are plenty of gamemodes, and the action is quite fast paced unless you playing on a tacticle crouch only server. With the addition of this game being able to be played on PC this game stands out for having an excellent modding community. However in my opinion the best thing about this well-crafted game is the Bonus Nazi Zombies maps. You fight against countless waves of zombies in a fun arcade type gamemode. Even though today it may take a while to find a Co-op Zombies match, it is 100% worth it once you finally do.    Overall, I would give this game a 9/10. The only negatives I could possibly think of is it's kind of hard to find people to play with nowadays on Co-op and some of the bugs and glitches scattered throughout the game.",1,arguably best call duty game entire franchise nothing bad game countless hours playing amazing game tell one best investments ever made life begin singleplayer campaign excellent atmosphere making feel fighting midst world war ii architecture maps great combine excellent story telling compelling visuals fair challenge campaign rather long call duty title took week finish entire campaign another excellent addition death cards use coop gives another reason dust campaign search death cards scattered throughout maps multiplayer also equally good plenty gamemodes action quite fast paced unless playing tacticle crouch server addition game able played pc game stands excellent modding community however opinion best thing wellcrafted game bonus nazi zombies maps fight countless waves zombies fun arcade type gamemode even though today may take find coop zombies match worth finally overall would give game negatives could possibly think kind hard find people play nowadays coop bugs glitches scattered throughout game

"Befor i start this Review by buying 'WORLD AT WAR' you can have unlimited zombie survival fun if you search on google 'WAW MODS' and find a good site you can download thousands of maps and weapons. World at War was announced on June 23, 2008 by Activision, who confirmed that the game was to be released in fall 2008, and that the series would revert to its customary World War II setting. The game had an approximately two-year-long development cycle, double that of Treyarch's previous entry to the series, Call of Duty 3. The game is powered by an enhanced version of the Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare engine, with several improvements made to the physics model. Environments are more destructible and can be set on fire with the flamethrower, which features propagating fire. Dismemberment, as well as realistic skin and clothes burning of the characters were added. Not long after, Treyarch released the modding tools for Call of Duty: World at War. These tools were the same ones used to create all the other Call of Duty series games, but with slight changes version to version, which can be downloaded online. Kiefer Sutherland and Gary Oldman were cast as voice actors for the game. Sutherland voices the narrator and squad leader of the American campaign, Sergeant Roebuck, while Oldman voices that of the Soviet campaign, Sergeant Reznov. A full-sized replica PBY Catalina was constructed for motion capture use. You honestly can not go wrong by buying this game its worth every penny. Highly Recommended!",1,befor start review buying world war unlimited zombie survival fun search google waw mods find good site download thousands maps weapons world war announced june activision confirmed game released fall series would revert customary world war ii setting game approximately twoyearlong development cycle double treyarchs previous entry series call duty game powered enhanced version call duty modern warfare engine several improvements made physics model environments destructible set fire flamethrower features propagating fire dismemberment well realistic skin clothes burning characters added long treyarch released modding tools call duty world war tools ones used create call duty series games slight changes version version downloaded online kiefer sutherland gary oldman cast voice actors game sutherland voices narrator squad leader american campaign sergeant roebuck oldman voices soviet campaign sergeant reznov fullsized replica pby catalina constructed motion capture use honestly go wrong buying game worth every penny highly recommended

"The German army began the blitzkrieg on 10 May 1940, the German Army Group B, led by Fedor von Bock, assaulted the BEF on 14 May. As Army Group B pushed the Allied forces back towards the French frontier, the German Army Group A, led by Gerd von Rundstedt, invaded France through the Ardennes. This caught the French unawares. The French High Command was sure that the expensive line of underground forts on the Maginot Line would stop any German attack. The Germans, however, decided not to attack this line. Instead they attacked the weakest part of the French defences, the Ardennes. This was a heavily wooded area that seemed unsuitable for tanks. The French had assumed it was unsuitable for tanks because it was a hilly and wooded area. French resistance crumbled as the German tanks raced to the Channel coast, where the Germans planned to cut off the retreat of the British Expeditionary Force. The German forces simply bypassed the Maginot line which was a situation not anticipated by the defending Allies. The offensive by Army Group A cut communications between French and British commands and after approaching Sedan the German group turned northwards.   On 13 May 1940, the Germans launched a Blitzkrieg attack on Belgium and Holland. It was an outstanding success. German attacks rolled swiftly across Holland and Belgium. Dutch attempts to delay the German advance by opening the dykes and flooding the land were ineffective. The Germans used glider planes to land behind the Belgian line of defences and outflank their defenders. Holland surrendered in five days after a huge bombing of Rotterdam. Thirteen days later the Belgians surrendered. The Netherlands and Luxembourg were overrun by 19 May.   . By 20 May 1940, huge numbers of British and French soldiers found themselves cut off from the rest of their forces. The push by Army Group A towards the coast combined with the approach of Army Group B from the northeast left the BEF surrounded on three sides by 21 May. The British forces attempted to stop the offensive and launched counter-attacks including at Arras on 21 May.   Fortunately for the British, on 20 May, Hitler gave the order to the German commander, Guderian, to stop his tanks in order to allow the Luftwaffe, the German air force, to complete the destruction of the British and French forces. This was a mistake which allowed the British time to regroup. However, the BEF was unable to repel the Germans and it became clear that the Channel ports were threatened. Fresh troops were rushed from England to defend Bolougne and Calais, but after hard fighting, both ports were in German hands by 26 May. General Gort ordered that the BEF should withdraw to Dunkirk, the only port remaining, for evacuation. The British launched ‘Operation Dynamo’. Between 27 May and 4 June, as the Luftwaffe pounded the beaches, the Royal Navy and a host of vessels ranging from yachts to pleasure boats crossed the Channel to rescue the stranded troops.

"My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him: 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately!'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me: 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.",1,grandfather smoked whole life years old mother said ever want see grandchildren graduate stop immediately tears welled eyes realized exactly stake gave immediately three years later died lung cancer really sad destroyed mother said dont ever smoke please dont put family grandfather put us agreed never touched cigarette must say feel slight sense regret never done game gave cancer anyway

"Hey do you want a fun fps really cheap well this game is for you. The campaign is good but short and in it you switch between a american soldier and a russian during ww2 also there is a card system in wich you will find cards throughout the campaign and these cards makes it harder or more fun much like the cheats in cod4.  The multiplayer is fun and probably the reason you buy a cod game and it is pretty fun but the progression can be pretty easy if you go into a high xp server. If thats bad thats up to you but i find it pretty neat that you can level up to 65 in a day or two. Another really good thing is community servers wich means that you will probably always find a game but there is something reall bad about the multiplayer and thats of course the , I suck at videogames so i have a hard time knowing whos hacking and whos not but i know that some people have hacked (one game nearly everyone died by granades so hackers).  Zombies is really awesome and the reason i buyed this game in the first place im not going to explain the actual mode instead im going to explain the maps. All maps are included  nacht der untoten is a great map and a great start for zombies but not the best map in the game but a great noob map veruckt is also a great map but harder then nacht due to tight corridoors but also includes perks wich is a perk from the multiplayer renamed and goes away when you down and it also includes traps that kills zombies and you if your unlucky and it also added power wich you need for traps,certain doors and perks. shi no numa didnt include much new exept for the mini boss hellhounds and a new wonderweapon called the wunderwaffe and a zipline. der riese is my favorite map in all zombies and it includes everything from the previous maps but adds teleporters and pack a punch wich is a machine that lets u uppgrade your weapons. and last all the modded zombie maps. They are really good and wellmade and play them is my recomendation and you might ask where do i download these maps? The best site i found i  zombiemodding.com .  Inconclusion this is a good cod game and worth playing even if you have the console version but wait for a sale but why the PC version you might ask well: the thing that makes the pc version great is that all dlc is included so all zombie maps and all multiplayer maps and as previosly mentiond community servers and mods.",1,hey want fun fps really cheap well game campaign good short switch american soldier russian ww also card system wich find cards throughout campaign cards makes harder fun much like cheats cod multiplayer fun probably reason buy cod game pretty fun progression pretty easy go high xp server thats bad thats find pretty neat level day two another really good thing community servers wich means probably always find game something reall bad multiplayer thats course suck videogames hard time knowing whos hacking whos know people hacked one game nearly everyone died granades hackers zombies really awesome reason buyed game first place im going explain actual mode instead im going explain maps maps included nacht der untoten great map great start zombies best map game great noob map veruckt also great map harder nacht due tight corridoors also includes perks wich perk multiplayer renamed goes away also includes traps kills zombies unlucky also added power wich need trapscertain doors perks shi numa didnt include much new exept mini boss hellhounds new wonderweapon called wunderwaffe zipline der riese favorite map zombies includes everything previous maps adds teleporters pack punch wich machine lets u uppgrade weapons last modded zombie maps really good wellmade play recomendation might ask download maps best site found zombiemoddingcom inconclusion good cod game worth playing even console version wait sale pc version might ask well thing makes pc version great dlc included zombie maps multiplayer maps previosly mentiond community servers mods

"Silo 2 is a pretty neat modeler, although unfortunately, nothing else. Still, I find myself really enjoying working in it, as it's a lot easier to use than most commercial software out there. The basic interface is pretty self explanitory, and isn't cluttered with things you won't need, however, you can pretty much customize it to your preference, so migrating from other software won't make you feel that out of place. I've used the demo first, for 30 days, and only had 1 crash happen, so far, It has been pretty stable for me.   If you want to buy this, try it out first, as some people don't seem to like it (but that's pretty common with everything anyways). You have to keep in mind, that everyone's preferences are different, so you have to find the right tool for you. There's a similar software called Voidworld, which is free, and was practically created to be a replacement for Silo, you can try that too and make comparrisons yourself. However, it's not as optimized, so it eats quite a lot of your resources, and might not run as good on your computer as on anyone elses (I practically couldn't use it, because it kept crashing, but I have a crappy laptop).   If you're looking for other, similar commercial software, you can also give Hexagon 2.5 a go (from Daz3D). It can do pretty much the same thing, with the addition of directly painting onto models, althought not as good in that field as 3D-Coat, as some parts of the UV need tweaking before you can begin painting (if you don't want to have streched textures on certain verticles). Unfortunately, that too, like Silo, is not being updated anymore. Still, don't let the lack of updates discourage you from software if you enjoy working with them. At the end of the day, it's all about what you like, and how you can utilize your tool anyways.  Also, If you're new to 3D modeling, make sure that you understand the basics. These are universal, and not exclusive to any kind of application. If you don't know your foundations, you might feel uncomfortable and let down, after a few failed attemps at translating your thoughts into a model.",1,silo pretty neat modeler although unfortunately nothing else still find really enjoying working lot easier use commercial software basic interface pretty self explanitory isnt cluttered things wont need however pretty much customize preference migrating software wont make feel place ive used demo first days crash happen far pretty stable want buy try first people dont seem like thats pretty common everything anyways keep mind everyones preferences different find right tool theres similar software called voidworld free practically created replacement silo try make comparrisons however optimized eats quite lot resources might run good computer anyone elses practically couldnt use kept crashing crappy laptop youre looking similar commercial software also give hexagon go dazd pretty much thing addition directly painting onto models althought good field dcoat parts uv need tweaking begin painting dont want streched textures certain verticles unfortunately like silo updated anymore still dont let lack updates discourage software enjoy working end day like utilize tool anyways also youre new modeling make sure understand basics universal exclusive kind application dont know foundations might feel uncomfortable let failed attemps translating thoughts model

"Pretty much what you might expect from a Call of Duty game, for better or worse. The graphics are pretty good, and there are some admittedly great set piece moments, but like every CoD game after the original game and its expansion, the majority of the campaign is pretty tedious and far too predicatable, and the story is really lazy and dumb, despite decent attempts to break the mold by good voice over by Gary Oldman and Kiefer Sutherland, and having the game take place in the Pacific and Eastern Europe, rather than Normandy and the Ardennes as is the case with most WWII shooters.  The multiplayer is definitely entertaining for a while, and I appreciate the campaign co-op option, but honestly the only reason I come back to this game at all is the mindless, yet hilariously fun Nazi Zombie mode; this alone was almost worth the price I paid, and would be the only reason I would consider picking up another CoD game in the future.",-1,pretty much might expect call duty game better worse graphics pretty good admittedly great set piece moments like every cod game original game expansion majority campaign pretty tedious far predicatable story really lazy dumb despite decent attempts break mold good voice gary oldman kiefer sutherland game take place pacific eastern europe rather normandy ardennes case wwii shooters multiplayer definitely entertaining appreciate campaign coop option honestly reason come back game mindless yet hilariously fun nazi zombie mode alone almost worth price paid would reason would consider picking another cod game future

"(single player review)  It's 2015, and you've already played this game. Remember the grenades? Of course you do.  The grenade danger indicator could have had more range. As it stands, the edge of the indicator is almost the same as the edge of a grenade's fatal radius, which means that almost as soon as the indicator appears on screen, you're in mortal danger. You'll just be walking around and then BOOM restart. This leads to a lot of frustrating and unfair deaths, even on the normal difficulty level (so much moreso on veteran). The window of time to press V for melee counterattacks is also painfully short. 90% of the time you die, it will be from one of those two things. Sometimes it will even be a combo! As you're on the ground fending off a melee attack, you'd better hope no grenades land at your feet, which happens so, so often.  This game also still doesn't understand player progression. Sitting behind cover and playing whack-a-mole doesn't work because of the infinitely respawning enemies. Killing some and then advancing often doesn't work because the rate of respawn is so high. The best strategy is often to just keep sprinting from cover to cover, avoid shooting anybody, and let your teammates advance, which is what the game seems to want you to do.  Play the campaign on normal, and you can have a fun few hours. Compared to Modern Warfare 1, it's faster-paced and has a nice arcade feel to it. The production is nice for a game of its time. There are a lot of loud noises. The Pacific levels are beautiful. There's a cool part shooting down kamikazes while rescuing sailors from the water. Kiefer Sutherland. There is a chug-chug guitar in the score, because at this point who gives a ♥♥♥♥. It's cinematic, it's intense, it's shallow, it's stupid, it's Call of Duty.",1,single player review youve already played game remember grenades course grenade danger indicator could range stands edge indicator almost edge grenades fatal radius means almost soon indicator appears screen youre mortal danger youll walking around boom restart leads lot frustrating unfair deaths even normal difficulty level much moreso veteran window time press v melee counterattacks also painfully short time die one two things sometimes even combo youre ground fending melee attack youd better hope grenades land feet happens often game also still doesnt understand player progression sitting behind cover playing whackamole doesnt work infinitely respawning enemies killing advancing often doesnt work rate respawn high best strategy often keep sprinting cover cover avoid shooting anybody let teammates advance game seems want play campaign normal fun hours compared modern warfare fasterpaced nice arcade feel production nice game time lot loud noises pacific levels beautiful theres cool part shooting kamikazes rescuing sailors water kiefer sutherland chugchug guitar score point gives cinematic intense shallow stupid call duty

"Counter-Strike was one of the first video games I have ever played and will always be up there in my list of favorite games.  I had just installed it. It was my first multiplayer game and I though I'm too new to play against players so I played only with bots slowly progressing from easy to to the hard ones. Then one day I joined a Dust II DM server. It was chaotic, but fun. I didn't even know the map then, but I learned it by playing lots of DM. I slowly climbed the integrated server ranks and made friends with one of the admins...then after a while the server disappeared.  After that I found out about deathrun. I was horrible at it, but the regulars helped me and I started visiting the server more and more. Apparently the same server chain had a gun game server too. Now that was amazing. Completely different people played there, but again friendly ones. After a couple of months the server chain was shut down...  I continued playing aim, awp, jailbreak and other mods. I didn't even play the classic mode, it wasn't of that big interest to me, though after a couple of months I stopped playing CS.  I can't not recommend this game, because I have so many memories from it.

"While Steam says I've only played 2 hours on WaW, my actual record (on Xbox 360) is 30 hours (Which means I finished the campaign and done a good bit of zombies and multiplayer), so I think I can review this game without getting assaulted over my playtime.   Campaign: I really liked it. It was just very well put together. SPOILERS:    You play from viewpoints of both the Red Army and the USMC   . My only problem with the story is not being able to see the perspectives of the Axis Powers, but other than that, the campaign is more than one reason to get WaW.  Multiplayer: Pretty much like Call of Duty 4's multiplayer, but with randomly spawning tanks you can hop in to help your allies. Still, it feels fast-paced, enough so that it's very enjoyable and has a high replay value.  Zombies: This is where the bias is coming in. I, and a lot of other CoD players, LOVE the Zombie Co-op/Survival mode, and it's pretty much the ♥♥♥♥ nowadays, so I'll leave it at that without getting too biased.  Final Verdict: So what score does Call of Nostalgia: We Miss World War II deserve? Well, it did come out with a lot of content at launch, multiplayer is decent, and Campaign and Zombies are pretty much the modes I would recommend to try out first. And as an added bonus, it's not future ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, not that I hate the new CoDs, they're just simply not as good as the WWII CoDs and, of course, the Modern Warfare trilogy.

"I couldnt decide what to write in this review , so im gonna share with you guys my favorite apple pie recipe Enjoy! :D  Pastry  2 cups all-purpose flour   1 teaspoon salt   2/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons shortening   4 to 6 tablespoons cold water   Filling  1/3 to 1/2 cup sugar   1/4 cup all-purpose flour   1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon   1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg   1/8 teaspoon salt   8 cups thinly sliced peeled tart apples (8 medium)   2 tablespoons butter or margarine   1) In medium bowl, mix 2 cups flour and 1 teaspoon salt. Cut in shortening, using pastry blender (or pulling 2 table knives through ingredients in opposite directions), until particles are size of small peas. Sprinkle with cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with fork until all flour is moistened and pastry almost cleans side of bowl (1 to 2 teaspoons more water can be added if necessary).  2) Gather pastry into a ball. Divide in half; shape into 2 flattened rounds on lightly floured surface. Wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate about 45 minutes or until dough is firm and cold, yet pliable. This allows the shortening to become slightly firm, which helps make the baked pastry more flaky. If refrigerated longer, let pastry soften slightly before rolling.  3) Heat oven to 425°F. With floured rolling pin, roll one pastry round into round 2 inches larger than upside-down 9-inch glass pie plate. Fold pastry into fourths; place in pie plate. Unfold and ease into plate, pressing firmly against bottom and side.  4) In large bowl, mix sugar, 1/4 cup flour, the cinnamon, nutmeg and 1/8 teaspoon salt. Stir in apples until well mixed. Spoon into pastry-lined pie plate. Cut butter into small pieces; sprinkle over filling. Trim overhanging edge of pastry 1/2 inch from rim of plate.  5) Roll other round of pastry into 10-inch round. Fold into fourths and cut slits so steam can escape. Unfold top pastry over filling; trim overhanging edge 1 inch from rim of plate. Fold and roll top edge under lower edge, pressing on rim to seal; flute as desired. Cover edge with 2- to 3-inch strip of foil to prevent excessive browning.  6) Bake 40 to 50 minutes or until crust is brown and juice begins to bubble through slits in crust, removing foil for last 15 minutes of baking.

"A great WWII shooter and one of the better CODs.  This game was made at a time when modern day first person shooters became popular. WWII shooters were left in the dust. As an attempt to still milk the dying popularity of WWII shooters, this game was made.  But it was quite different.  Sure, the campaign was simple and lacking innovation. Same goes for the multiplayer. This game was heavily built off of CoD 4's engine, so that can explain a lot.  But one thing made this game awesome.  Zombies.  Zombies is an addicting and fun gamemode to play, if you have friends. If you and a friend want a co-op game, get this or Borderlands 2. The modding community for this game has made so much custom zombie maps, weapons, etc, so you never get bored.  Final Verdict: 8.5 to 9/10  Why 8.5:  Zombies is the only part of this game that really is awesome. The rest is just average or 'meh' for an fps.  also zombie loading screens have ads for intel core and the developer, treyarch, lel.",1,great wwii shooter one better cods game made time modern day first person shooters became popular wwii shooters left dust attempt still milk dying popularity wwii shooters game made quite different sure campaign simple lacking innovation goes multiplayer game heavily built cod engine explain lot one thing made game awesome zombies zombies addicting fun gamemode play friends friend want coop game get borderlands modding community game made much custom zombie maps weapons etc never get bored final verdict zombies part game really awesome rest average meh fps also zombie loading screens ads intel core developer treyarch lel

"CoD: World at War, is EASILY one of the best Call of Duty games ever made. First off, the game goes back to its WW2 roots, after the giant success which is Modern Warfare. The single player campaign is solid, it really helps that WaW focuses on some of the less popular battles from World War II, instead of giving you battles on D-Day at Normandy, which would have been like the millionth recreation within a WW2 game, the game covers an American campaign across multiple islands in the Pacific, as well as the Red Army's comeback at the battle of Stalingrad, which leads up to the Fall of Berlin. All of this provides lots of interesting new battlefields. You will still see some more familiar spots within bombed-out cities, and the farmlands of the Eastern Front missions, but it is all still incredibly well done. War, as you probably know, is an unforgiving and brutal affair, but the Pacific and the Eastern Front were especially so. In the game, Japanese soldiers will swarm you out of bushes, erupting straight out of spider holes and charge straight at you in an attempt to run you through with their bayonets. They'll play dead and wait for you to walk into the middle of a trap. Although the game is primarily set outdoors, most of the game is played in close quarters combat. Meanwhile, on the Russian Front, there are plenty of absoulutely merciless moments to be had. Soldiers on both sides of the war on this front, Russian, and German. Soldiers of both sides gun down wounded or unarmed soldiers, and sometimes you're asked to pull the trigger yourself in situations like this. But, this remains a Call of Duty game, through and through. What I mean by this, is that the action is both fast, and fluid, and the game is rigidly scripted. Enemy soldiers, as well as your computer-controlled teammates respawn endlessy until you advance far enough to hit the triggers to make them stop coming at you. Then, you find yourself at the next firefight, and repeat the process all over again, but, you're usually far too busy ducking, and shooting your way around the level, and occasionaly dying, to really notice this much of the time. The sense of immersion is really outstanding. There are plenty of deafinging, large-scale battles, but there's also a bit of variation to change things up. A perfect example is the PBY mission, where man the guns of a Navy aircraft, while you are in the midst of a raging air AND sea battle, taking fire, and fighting for your life, while trying to save the lives of sailors stranded in the water. All of this sounds great, but it hurts the game in one way. The narrative skips over months at a time, and showcases the major battles in the campaign. The result of this, is that the sense of story may not be as strong as you would expect it to be. In the end, the single-player campaign is relatively short, but it doesn't drag on too long to be unenjoyable either. And, as a bonus, there is a lot of replayability in the story, because the bulk of the campaign is playable in cooperative mode, with up to three other players. Multiplayer (while it has A LOT less players than console, or than when the game originally launched) is an area where WaW shines REALLY bright. Modern Warfare, quite arguably had on of the best multiplayer suites in history, and WaW built upon it. There is a create-a-class system, and a ranking system, that lets you unlock perks, weapons, and other general upgrades, that you can use as the building blocks for tailor your own personal load-out, and play-style. Kill-streaks are in the game, and are simmilar to Modern Warfare's, but with a twist more accurate to the time frame of the game.  (UAV=Spotting Plane, Airstrike=Artillery Strike, Attack Helicopter=Attack Dogs) There is also plenty of game mades to choose from. Then, there's my personal favorite aspect to the game. Nazi. Mother♥♥♥♥ing. Zombies. Nazi Zombies is a game mode, where you and up to three others are put together against an endless onslaught of neverending waves of zombies. As you progress the waves get harder, either by adding more total zombies, making them faster, or both. You gain points for killing zombies, and rebuilding baricades, and these points can be used to buy weapons, ammo, and to open doors granting you access to other parts of the map. There's even a mystery box, which costs 950 points for every weapon, that gives you a random weapon. One of those van even be a ray gun, straight out of 1940's era pulp fiction. And, as an added bonus on PC, you get all 3 bonus maps included with the game, which cost 9.99 each on console, and the wonder of custom maps. You can download a free, and safe map launcher, from which you can download maps made buy the community, with the same rules as before, unless changed by the creator. Overall, the game is PACKED with a ridiculously deep amount of gameplay, with appeal to almost every kind of player. All the way from those who want to experience a gritty solo campaign, those who want to play with their friends, and those just want to play the multiplayer. The game is an awesome addition to the franchise, with plenty to offer to the casual gamer, and the hardcore gamer alike.-----9.75/10",1,cod world war easily one best call duty games ever made first game goes back ww roots giant success modern warfare single player campaign solid really helps waw focuses less popular battles world war ii instead giving battles dday normandy would like millionth recreation within ww game game covers american campaign across multiple islands pacific well red armys comeback battle stalingrad leads fall berlin provides lots interesting new battlefields still see familiar spots within bombedout cities farmlands eastern front missions still incredibly well done war probably know unforgiving brutal affair pacific eastern front especially game japanese soldiers swarm bushes erupting straight spider holes charge straight attempt run bayonets theyll play dead wait walk middle trap although game primarily set outdoors game played close quarters combat meanwhile russian front plenty absoulutely merciless moments soldiers sides war front russian german soldiers sides gun wounded unarmed soldiers sometimes youre asked pull trigger situations like remains call duty game mean action fast fluid game rigidly scripted enemy soldiers well computercontrolled teammates respawn endlessy advance far enough hit triggers make stop coming find next firefight repeat process youre usually far busy ducking shooting way around level occasionaly dying really notice much time sense immersion really outstanding plenty deafinging largescale battles theres also bit variation change things perfect example pby mission man guns navy aircraft midst raging air sea battle taking fire fighting life trying save lives sailors stranded water sounds great hurts game one way narrative skips months time showcases major battles campaign result sense story may strong would expect end singleplayer campaign relatively short doesnt drag long unenjoyable either bonus lot replayability story bulk campaign playable cooperative mode three players multiplayer lot less players console game originally launched area waw shines really bright modern warfare quite arguably best multiplayer suites history waw built upon createaclass system ranking system lets unlock perks weapons general upgrades use building blocks tailor personal loadout playstyle killstreaks game simmilar modern warfares twist accurate time frame game uavspotting plane airstrikeartillery strike attack helicopterattack dogs also plenty game mades choose theres personal favorite aspect game nazi mothering zombies nazi zombies game mode three others put together endless onslaught neverending waves zombies progress waves get harder either adding total zombies making faster gain points killing zombies rebuilding baricades points used buy weapons ammo open doors granting access parts map theres even mystery box costs points every weapon gives random weapon one van even ray gun straight era pulp fiction added bonus pc get bonus maps included game cost console wonder custom maps download free safe map launcher download maps made buy community rules unless changed creator overall game packed ridiculously deep amount gameplay appeal almost every kind player way want experience gritty solo campaign want play friends want play multiplayer game awesome addition franchise plenty offer casual gamer hardcore gamer alike

"8.7 out of 10    Multiplayer (7.9/10)   One of the most requested multiplayers in a call of duty game; WW2, Not overpowered, Tanks. World at War lives up too its name being one of the best multiplayer games that i have played in a long time, custom servers that are moddable and dedicated servers? what more can you ask in a multiplayer game. Weapons are very fun to use in this game aswell as perks and lethals. Punkbuster is the reason this game doesnt get 8.2, it doesn't help the community, it's false and doesn't work in most cases. Very glitchy but what can you expect for 2008.   Zombies (9.6/10)   You can't say that this game doesnt have the best zombies a game could have, you just cant. Easily the best Call of Duty zombies game there is. The game isn't what makes it the best its the CUSTOM MAPS, thats right; you can play anything from halloween maps to christmas or maps from OTHER games even. Had so much fun playing zombies with my friends and what inspired me to buy this game, the only reason this doesn't get a perfect score is the OPTIMIZATION and BUGS. For example. when someone ALT's out of the game for a second and there the host of the zombies map it will spam 'CONNECTION INTERUPTED' due to the packet loss when you alt, a bit annoying but i think we can live with it :)   Campaign (8.7/10) -    Yet again, WaW delivers, With one of the most immersive storyline's a Call of Duty has ever had. Set in the WW2 era, by far the most gorey campaign. This game is one if not the BEST Call of Duty story in history.

"I played this game when it first came out and let me tell you, it was amazing! You may ask yourself why, and write it off as a simple am gimmicky game. The truth is that this game takes some serious skills and has a lot more depth then you would think. There used to be a small friendly and competitive community back in the day and we would host our own tournements. The reason this game died out is not because it wasn't good, it's because there has always been a problem hosting games and playing with others. You see the developer never added dedicated servers as a feature, therefore we all played through pretty much one or two people who somehow were able to host the game.

This is a FPS game that most gamers know and the ones that don't should. The laughable half an hour I have displayed here was just testing out the newly bought game. In reality I have played many many many hours with my friends. I played it in high school. I played it in college. I played it with friends after work. While the graphics may be old and this game replaced by its' younger sibblings it still holds out the test of time. While I am no longer able to get my friends together and play this , this game will always be a fond memory for me. And who knows maybe I will pick it up some day again. What I can do is recommend this game to anyone who has not played it or people who are thinking about pruchasing this digital copy. The basic concept of terrorists vs. counter-terrorists is really fun and with the modding community the amount of variation is almost limitless. So grab it if you can, it is very much worth it.",1,pros great gameplay big active community great choice weapons huge amount mods lots community created maps weapons ai soundtracks etc cons rare issues graphic cards especially laptops replacement form newer cs games comment introduce fps game gamers know ones dont laughable half hour displayed testing newly bought game reality played many many many hours friends played high school played college played friends work graphics may old game replaced younger sibblings still holds test time longer able get friends together play game always fond memory knows maybe pick day recommend game anyone played people thinking pruchasing digital copy basic concept terrorists vs counterterrorists really fun modding community amount variation almost limitless grab much worth

Although online is currently pluaged with cheeters on servers with no admins, it addresses most of the perk balancing issues I had with Modern Warfare, and made a lot of the equipment perks (and even some of the more underated red and yellow perks) viable with the inclusion of tanks.  The maps are memorable, the headshot noise is legendary, and it's a blast to play if you schedule a night to play it with your friends.

"I first played Counter-Strike back in 1999, when it was still just a mod. I went to it on a daily basis, for several hours, as my main source of entertainment and gathering of friends until about 2002, when other activities came along. I only went back to it now, in 2012. This unveiled the greatest disappointment and proof of destruction of a game I have ever experienced. As it is today, this is not Counter-Strike. It is a broken, unrecognizable, nearly useless form of the original game. Valve has let this game rot to death and still make an easy profit for nothing. The server browser is a joke. It is simply broken. The results it returns are completely inaccurate and all servers you will find are run by non-Steam users, with the game settings altered to who knows what, and 90% of them playing the Dust map. The other servers are running non-official maps and pointless game modes. In addition, you can not set your client to disallow the automatic download of custom server sounds or other trash that is force-fed through your connection to alter the game. Counter-Strike has been so blatantly abandoned, that it is shocking Valve still charges something for it. You will also see advertisements while you are connecting to the servers, and while you wait for the next round once you have been killed. Counter-Strike is the epitome of falling from grace and becoming an outright failure. It has become an embarrassment and a gaming tragedy.

"This was one of the Call of Duty that i wanted to play the campaign because it was good, the multiplayer was all right, nothing great, nothing too bad, with bots, it could have been better. At least, you can find a bot mod on the internet so that's cool.  You should buy this game during sales and if you wanna play it for the multiplayer, either you forget it or you download the mod to play with bots cause the multiplayer doesn't works so well and there are many hackers in it anyway.  The best thing about this game, I'd say that it is the music and the amount of weapons, there are not that many weapons but unlike most of the World War II games, there are more, even if they're not that great nor realistic, we have a good amount of weapons here. So the music is the best thing about this game.  7.5/10",1,one call duty wanted play campaign good multiplayer right nothing great nothing bad bots could better least find bot mod internet thats cool buy game sales wanna play multiplayer either forget download mod play bots cause multiplayer doesnt works well many hackers anyway best thing game id say music amount weapons many weapons unlike world war ii games even theyre great realistic good amount weapons music best thing game

" Arguably the best of the franchise and well populated. Brilliantly nostalgic and still an absolute joy to play. PunkBuster can be a problem however.   'Call of Duty' was and remains a franchise at the forefront of the online FPS genre. Dominating both console and PC alike, it's rivaled some would say, only by it's EA counterpart 'Battlefield'; but 'World at War' was something else. Released in 2008 it adapted and built perfectly on the foundations set the previous year by Activision's installment in the series - 'Modern Warfare'.  Trearch's addition gave us features the likes of which we'd never seen in 'Call of Duty 4'. Vehicles. Tanks. Though on face value a simple addtion, their inclusion was well implimented and appropriatley balanced. We were also graced with a slightly new approach to the killstreak system, seeing the introduction of attack dogs; along with a tweaked 'Create-A-Class' system made to feel more period accurate, with bolt action rifles becoming an entierly different weapon type paired with the ability to use their iron-sights, as apposed to being restricted to a telescopic sight.  In terms of singleplayer, this installment saw you brave the horrors of WWII from both a Russian and American perspective; battling the Japanesse on Iwo Jima and beating down the 3rd Reich from Stalingrad to Berlin. Featuring the voice talents of Keifer Sutherland for the American Sgt. Roebuck, and Gary Oldman for the premier of the legendary hard-as-nails Russian sniper - Viktor Reznov. The campaign is both compelling and fantasicaly written with mixes of close and ranged combat along a spectrum of locales beautifully designed and planned. The singleplayer is, as far as im concerned, unsurpassable by any other 'Call of Duty' game.   However, my one biggest fault with 'Call of Duty: World at War' is the unfortunate lack of PunkBuster support. The anti-cheat system which now seems abandoned and disused is still required to play some servers in online matchmaking. Needing some Google searching to find a download of the appropriate files to enable the system to work. Although once this is done, the game plays fine and without further fault.  Oh, and not to mention. Zombies.   Recommended?:  Yes.  Score:  9/10",1,arguably best franchise well populated brilliantly nostalgic still absolute joy play punkbuster problem however call duty remains franchise forefront online fps genre dominating console pc alike rivaled would say ea counterpart battlefield world war something else released adapted built perfectly foundations set previous year activisions installment series modern warfare trearchs addition gave us features likes wed never seen call duty vehicles tanks though face value simple addtion inclusion well implimented appropriatley balanced also graced slightly new approach killstreak system seeing introduction attack dogs along tweaked createaclass system made feel period accurate bolt action rifles becoming entierly different weapon type paired ability use ironsights apposed restricted telescopic sight terms singleplayer installment saw brave horrors wwii russian american perspective battling japanesse iwo jima beating rd reich stalingrad berlin featuring voice talents keifer sutherland american sgt roebuck gary oldman premier legendary hardasnails russian sniper viktor reznov campaign compelling fantasicaly written mixes close ranged combat along spectrum locales beautifully designed planned singleplayer far im concerned unsurpassable call duty game however one biggest fault call duty world war unfortunate lack punkbuster support anticheat system seems abandoned disused still required play servers online matchmaking needing google searching find download appropriate files enable system work although done game plays fine without fault oh mention zombies recommended yes score

"After playing 12 hours (and even days of playing on console and other accounts) of Call of Duty V: World at War, I can say this game is dead.

"My first and only CoD game so far, save for Black Ops II, which I played on a friend's Wii-U. The campaign, although short, was actually surprisingly good. I enjoyed the contrast between the American campaign in the Pacific against the Japanese (this one has the better environment) and the Soviet campaign in the East against the Nazis (this one is the overall better of the two, but only just). I always appreciate variety, and there was certainly enough to go around here. The weapons selection is what one would expect from a WWII period FPS, but, again, the different factions mean that there is more than enough to choose from (American, Russian, Japanese, or German). Nazi Zombies mode is quite difficult, but if one can get some friends to join, it provides considerable entertainment. Shi No Numa is probably the best map so far. Spring for a double-barreled shotgun and a Ray Gun if possible! Overall it is worth the price of admission.  9.5/10",1,first cod game far save black ops ii played friends wiiu campaign although short actually surprisingly good enjoyed contrast american campaign pacific japanese one better environment soviet campaign east nazis one overall better two always appreciate variety certainly enough go around weapons selection one would expect wwii period fps different factions mean enough choose american russian japanese german nazi zombies mode quite difficult one get friends join provides considerable entertainment shi numa probably best map far spring doublebarreled shotgun ray gun possible overall worth price admission

When developers of this game genre learn that this 2 things are the most inportant for good FPS, they will make a game as good as CS 1.6 is... CS:GO does not have these major aspects, and doesn't deserve name of Counter-Strike (IMO). As a third very important thing for FPS game, I would say the animations... The animations of player models such as runnig, walking, crouching, gun holding/fireing/reloading etc... Graphics isn't so important, doesn't need to be sooo good, but decent due to visibility...",1,best game ever made domination movemenet shooting mechanics recoil exaclty fps game need developers game genre learn things inportant good fps make game good cs csgo major aspects doesnt deserve name counterstrike imo third important thing fps game would say animations animations player models runnig walking crouching gun holdingfireingreloading etc graphics isnt important doesnt need sooo good decent due visibility

"I used to play this game on ps3 with my friends all the time. When I got my 360 this was one of the first games I got. This is COD back when it was enjoyable. This game is great probably one of my all time favorite games. Between 3 systems I bet I have near 1000 hours. This game was why I even downloaded steam in the first place. Great game, even by today's standards.   There is a gritty feel here that other large titles have really failed in trying to replicate. The campaign is good by call of duty standards. CO-OP was fun but is pretty dead now.   The real fun is in Zombies and Multiplayer. The zombie maps in this game to me are the best. It was before everything got so complicated. Its just you, up to 3 other people, some guns, some doors, and the occasional power switch. No staffs or fuses here. There are plenty of mods and custom maps if thats your thing though. A lot of later zombies maps are remade by the community as customs maps so you can have a pretty complete collection, as well as some totally custom ones. The multiplayer is great the maps are over two theaters of war and there is a lot of variety which means most people usually have a few maps they like. The MP is still pretty active especially on weekends. If you have trouble finding a game there is always the bot mod that allows you to beat on AI bots.   I really cannot say enough good things about this game and the PC version not only looks better but is more fun. 10/10.",1,used play game ps friends time got one first games got cod back enjoyable game great probably one time favorite games systems bet near hours game even downloaded steam first place great game even todays standards gritty feel large titles really failed trying replicate campaign good call duty standards coop fun pretty dead real fun zombies multiplayer zombie maps game best everything got complicated people guns doors occasional power switch staffs fuses plenty mods custom maps thats thing though lot later zombies maps remade community customs maps pretty complete collection well totally custom ones multiplayer great maps two theaters war lot variety means people usually maps like mp still pretty active especially weekends trouble finding game always bot mod allows beat ai bots really cannot say enough good things game pc version looks better fun

"First of all its my first online game ever. I was very young and i was playing with my friends LAN matches sometimes for fun sometimes with bets the loser treats refreshments. xD This game its the reason that i maked my mum to buy me a PC to playing this game at my home. With the time i learn how to modding on CS 1.6 servers,plugins and more stuffs about PC. After this i learn how to aim on the enemy head, how to fire inside the walls, how to hear someone with his steps and HOW TO FIGHT!!! I have played many FPS(First Person Shooter) Games that they called me hacker of my fast killing. I had so fyckin good and bad moments on that game that i will not forget never.

"If your looking for a review on this game you\'ve come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding cheese cake recipe you\'ve come to the right place.  Ingredients:  1 cup digestive plain sweet biscuit crumbs 3 tablespoons sugar 3 tablespoons melted butter 40 ounces softened cream cheese 1 cup sugar 3 tablespoons flour 1 tablespoon vanilla 1 cup sour cream 4 eggs  Directions: For The base:. If you\'re using a dark pan, preheat the oven to 350. If you are using a shiny pan, 375. Combine the crumbs, melted butter and 3 tbsp sugar well and pat onto the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan. I also like to very very lightly butter the sides of the pan so that the cheesecake will not stick later on. Bake for 10 mins in your preheated oven and remove. Let it cool while you prepare your batter. For the batter:. Make sure everything is at room temperature. Combine sugar, cheese, flour and vanilla in a big bowl and mix on medium speed till well combined. Don\'t forget to scrape the bowl as you\'re doing this. Mix in the sour cream till its incorporated well. Then, add the eggs one by one, mixing well after each addition. Pour the batter into the springform and let it bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes After the baking time, turn off the oven and leave the door ajar. Let the cake cool in there for about 1 1/2 hours. Remove the cake and let it cool thoroughly. Refrigerate overnight. Release the sides of the springform.

"Most likely too be the best CoD out there (On par with CoD 4). The multiplayer is amazing (without hackers), the zombies is great, and with mods making the experience even better. If you wanted too buy a cod game, I would reccomend this game or CoD 4. Also, the campaign (In my opinion) is GREAT. If you were too offer me CoD WaW, and Infinite Warfare, I would choose CoD WaW. The only downside is the ammount of hackers on multiplayer. The multiplayer can get REALLY annoying when there are hackers almost every game. But, most community servers (I think) have external Anti-Cheat systems, so Horray! to that.

"My Honest Review Of COD: World at War.  The base game is decent and fun, your standard COD game, But this is the game that started the Zombies Mode. Story is ok, Better if you're doing COOP and with Death Cards on. Multiplayer is decent, Good thing it has Dedicated Servers, as game is mainly dead. But there seems to be many servers filled with people still playing the game. Now here we go with the good stuff. ZOMBIES the only real reason to buy this game, there is a HUGE modding fanbase for this game it is crazy, like Project Viking, Nact Reimagined, and many more. The modding community actually does better than what many devs can’t to, which is add replayability. There are so many good mods it's well worth your purchase.  Pros: Massive amount of mods for Zombies and even Multiplayer. ZOMBIES Dedicated Servers COOP  Cons: Ping, dear god it can sometimes be terrible. Dead Multiplayer, yes even Zombies is too.  Overall I give this game a 8/10",1,honest review cod world war base game decent fun standard cod game game started zombies mode story ok better youre coop death cards multiplayer decent good thing dedicated servers game mainly dead seems many servers filled people still playing game go good stuff zombies real reason buy game huge modding fanbase game crazy like project viking nact reimagined many modding community actually better many devs cant add replayability many good mods well worth purchase pros massive amount mods zombies even multiplayer zombies dedicated servers coop cons ping dear god sometimes terrible dead multiplayer yes even zombies overall give game

The mulitplayer has a surprisingly decent amount of players playing it and on the right servers you will always be able to find a game and boy is it fun. Zombies is also very fun and I would reccomend getting it with your friends for a real good time, because usually you'll have to wait awhile to find a zombie match. Just all together this game ( atleast the campaign, and dont get me started on how amazing the seige on berlin is ) actually feels like a war and is a really good FPS.

It is basically black ops 3 without thrust jumping and specialists, but it basically is the same game. Very fun and if you want a game that will be a 'new' Call of Duty, this is the game for you. Many people who played CoD don't even know about the originals and how they were world war two themed. It runs with easily 70 FPS on my newly built gaming rig with a Nvidia GeForce GTX 950 graphics card. Very fun and I definately recommend it. Basically a BO3 with slightly less graphics compared to the BLOPS series, about as good if not better than the original Black Ops. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Also, for zombies players like myself ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- If there is any game for zombies for fans like me, this is the game to pick. It gives you Nacht Der Untoten, Verrukt, Shi No Numa, and Der Riese for free. But with one cost. You have to beat the campaign. I dont know if you have to play on regular or higher difficulty, but just to stay on the safe side go for regular to unlock zombies. You also get all custom zombies maps, although the are a little hard to download, it is pretty easy. You basically get all zombies maps ever because i bet almost all maps like Kino were remade through custom maps. Also, there are fun custom zombiies maps that are really cool, like CXCA, or Leviathan. But deffinitely Recomended for zombies players. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Rating -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I give this a five out of five star rating game for all CoD fans or people getting into the series. Deffinately worth the $20. I hope you enjoyed my review and even found it helpful.",1,bought game played one level campaign im speedrunning zombies wow actually lot better thought basically black ops without thrust jumping specialists basically game fun want game new call duty game many people played cod dont even know originals world war two themed runs easily fps newly built gaming rig nvidia geforce gtx graphics card fun definately recommend basically bo slightly less graphics compared blops series good better original black ops also zombies players like game zombies fans like game pick gives nacht der untoten verrukt shi numa der riese free one cost beat campaign dont know play regular higher difficulty stay safe side go regular unlock zombies also get custom zombies maps although little hard download pretty easy basically get zombies maps ever bet almost maps like kino remade custom maps also fun custom zombiies maps really cool like cxca leviathan deffinitely recomended zombies players rating give five five star rating game cod fans people getting series deffinately worth hope enjoyed review even found helpful

"The mother of all FPS games! Although some may argue that this is a outdated game, I still love it. You get that awesome freedom of movement which you cannot get on CS:S (as much) and on CS:GO. In addition, this game nearly runs on all pc's even potato's with wires. It has a large modding team behind it (AMXX), which isn't affiliated with Valve but nevertheless it makes the game 100x better, and adds amazing mods to it.",1,mother fps games although may argue outdated game still love get awesome freedom movement cannot get css much csgo addition game nearly runs pcs even potatos wires large modding team behind amxx isnt affiliated valve nevertheless makes game x better adds amazing mods

"Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter in which players join either the terrorist team, the counter-terrorist team, or become spectators. Each team attempts to complete their mission objective and/or eliminate the opposing team. Each round starts with the two teams spawning simultaneously.  The objectives vary depending on the type of map, and these are the most usual ones:  Bomb Maps: The terrorists must carry a bomb, plant it on one of the designated spots and protect it from being disarmed by the counter-terrorists before it explodes to win. The counter-terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion. Hostage Maps: The counter-terrorists must rescue a group of hostages held by the terrorists to win. The terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion. VIP Maps: One of the counter-terrorists is chosen to act as a VIP and the team must escort this player to a designated spot on the map to win the game. The terrorists win if the VIP is killed or if the time runs out with no conclusion.",1,counterstrike firstperson shooter players join either terrorist team counterterrorist team become spectators team attempts complete mission objective andor eliminate opposing team round starts two teams spawning simultaneously objectives vary depending type map usual ones bomb maps terrorists must carry bomb plant one designated spots protect disarmed counterterrorists explodes win counterterrorists win time runs conclusion hostage maps counterterrorists must rescue group hostages held terrorists win terrorists win time runs conclusion vip maps one counterterrorists chosen act vip team must escort player designated spot map win game terrorists win vip killed time runs conclusion

This is a game that NEEDS to be tried at least once For multiplayer? Nah your silly Zombies  With custom zombies existing its some of the most fun Especially with friends  A few maps I recommend Leviathan UGX Requium UGX Cabin Mario 64  And more its definetly worth the game  But dont do multiplayer if you can even find a game it WILL have hackers 9/10 Little edit...

"The story mode can be summarized with 'Run that way, kill those dudes, and capture the objective.' The multiplayer is typical post-Call of Duty 4 mechanics. But, come on, we all know that at this point, you're not buying this game for the story or the multiplayer. You're buying it for the Nazi Zombies. And fortunately, they're all here. Through the grace of Gaben, all the DLC is included with your game with no extra purchases required. You get all four zombie maps included and ready to play. And all the multiplayer maps too, if that's what you're into. Somehow, though, the multiplayer is still pretty smooth, with hackers being all but absent from play.  I give this game 5/5 free map packs for being functional, having a mode of play that's still likable almost six years later, and for existing before the Call of Duty franchise became synonymous with 'repetitive'.",1,story mode summarized run way kill dudes capture objective multiplayer typical postcall duty mechanics come know point youre buying game story multiplayer youre buying nazi zombies fortunately theyre grace gaben dlc included game extra purchases required get four zombie maps included ready play multiplayer maps thats youre somehow though multiplayer still pretty smooth hackers absent play give game free map packs functional mode play thats still likable almost six years later existing call duty franchise became synonymous repetitive

Sure maybe that black ops 3 beats world at war in vanilla maps, but theres many custom maps created by the community. I think that Tryarch can make some inprovements in the upcomming game Invinite warfare",1,old game would say beating black ops reviews makes call duty world war better black ops thousands community created fans hand black ops hasnt sort custom maps sure maybe black ops beats world war vanilla maps theres many custom maps created community think tryarch make inprovements upcomming game invinite warfare

"Best WWII shooter single and multiplayer ever. That being said, my main criticism for single player mode for this game and all war simulators is: CHILL OUT. War is not a constant train of frantic battles one after the other. Let me have some room to breathe, some down time while I crawl around the ruins. That can actually make it a richer, even more intense experience, as just when I think I am safe and able to just look around, a sniper takes a pot shot.  MP could use some reality tweaks. Real people can't hop all day in heavy combat gear or drop from crawl to stand in a split second.",1,best wwii shooter single multiplayer ever said main criticism single player mode game war simulators chill war constant train frantic battles one let room breathe time crawl around ruins actually make richer even intense experience think safe able look around sniper takes pot shot mp could use reality tweaks real people cant hop day heavy combat gear drop crawl stand split second

"The Call of Duty series gets a lot of flack from people, myself included. Played the first one, kinda liked it halfway through, and then absolutely hated the rest of it. Didn't like Modern Warfare, didn't care for Black Ops, and I'm not even touching Advanced Warfare. But this game... this game feels different. It truly feels like war, and it has a much more serious atmosphere for most of the game than most all other games. And the Nazi Germans actually speak German, what a concept. If you're wanting to experience something that gives you the chills of war without walking into the frontlines yourself, I would recommend this game. It's morose, and gives you that feeling of desparation, hardship, and then victory when you push through. The soundtrack is excellent as well. No matter how many times I play this game, I always feel like I've walked back in time to a far worse place. Makes me appreciate where I am right now. Oh, and this is the first game where Nazi Zombies came out. The first few maps that came with this one are just as atmospheric, and the zombies feel much more intense. A fun diversion from the story of World at War. If you enjoy it, well on ya. If you don't, I can totally understand.

"When Infinity Ward released Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare back in 2007, the developer was met with critical acclaim and praise for breaking away from the World War II setting that had started to bog down the once revolutionary series. That made Treyarch's decision to bring the fifth installment back to the historical time period that much more confusing - why mess with success? Well, Call of Duty: World at War returns to the series' roots, and is a good reminder of why World War II games became so popular in the first place - the tone is gritty, the pace is frantic, and the action is visceral.  World at War's story is split between two very different fronts - the ferocious jungle campaign of the Pacific theatre, and the retaliatory invasion of the Russians on the Eastern front. That's right - no pesky Normandy invasions this time around! In the Pacific, you take on the role of Private Miller of the United States Marine Corps, and take part in the island hopping campaign towards Okinawa. On the Eastern Front, you play as Private Dimitri Petrenko, and are tasked with pushing the Nazis out of Russia and marching into Berlin. The campaign is paced exceptionally well so that after a few missions of fighting as Miller in the Pacific, you'll switch over to play as Dimitri in Eastern Europe. This stops the campaign from becoming stale, keeping it fresh and exciting.  Perhaps the best part of the campaign is the sheer amount of variety found in the missions. The first mission as Private Petrenko, for example, comes straight out of the movie Enemy at the Gates. Narrowly surviving a massacre in Nazi controlled Stalingrad, you and an injured comrade have to make your way through the enemy filled streets armed with only a sniper rifle in order to assassinate the German General. In addition to sniper duels, you'll also have to burn out enemy fortifications during the campaign, as well as command a tank through enemy infested Germany.  One of the most memorable missions has you playing as neither Miller nor Petrenko, but Petty Officer Locke, a gunner for a PBY Catalina flying boat. In addition to shooting down Japanese patrol boats, merchant ships, and fighter planes, you'll have to try and rescue American sailors stranded in the sea after their fleet is decimated by a squadron of kamikaze fighters. The mission is really unique, and the intensity ramps up significantly as more Japanese planes show up, and ammo starts becoming scarce. The first person views of the plane's interior as well as the exceptional dialogue make this mission much more than a standard rail shooting experience.  Although it is overall an invigorating experience, the campaign does have a few faults - most notably, some annoying glitches. For example, in order to finish one mission, you have to regroup with your squad. The mission won't end, however, until you backtrack half way through the level and unstick one of your AI buddies with a grenade - something that obviously shouldn't make into the finished product. There are a few other minor glitches as well, such as the little grenade symbol by your feet sometimes staying on screen long after its explosion, but these usually don't have an effect on the gameplay, and are thus easily ignorable.  As great as the campaign is alone, it's even greater with a few friends. World at War allows you to play through the entire campaign with up to three friends, and you can even turn on competitive scoring, much like in Halo 3, to add a new layer of depth when playing with friends. The other co-operative mode in World at War is the ever-addictive Nazi Zombies. With a few friends, you get to fight off a never-ending horde of Nazi Zombies, starting off with just a pistol. As the game continues, and the waves get progressively harder and harder, new guns are available to purchase. It's hectic and crazy, and although no Left 4 Dead, it is a heck of a lot of fun.   If Nazi Zombies isn't your thing, then you might find World at War's multiplayer more enjoyable. Treyarch took the super addictive multiplayer system from Modern Warfare, and it still is great. Classes, perks, prestige classes - it's all here. Of course, some of the technology present in Call of Duty 4 wasn't around back in the 1940's, so Treyarch did have to make a few, slight changes. For example, instead of being able to call in Helicopters after getting a killing streak, you can bring in attack dogs to attack your foes, or call in artillery strikes to bombard enemy positions. The essentials are all the same however. You get experience points for killing enemies and winning matches, which can be used to unlock new, powerful guns, weapon accessories and armor, and better perks. The prestige class returns as well, allowing you to return to level 1 after reaching the maximum level. You can do this up to 10 times, so if you are dedicated in getting to the top, be prepared to put a lot of hours in World at War.   The graphics in World at War are stunning, with dazzling explosions lighting up the screen and individual character models looking impressively detailed, especially up close, such as when a Banzai soldier jumps on you with a bayonet in your face. The animations are spectacular as well, with no two soldiers dying the same way. You can even blow off individual body parts off with certain weapons, like the shotgun, which is of course extremely satisfying. The game's audio also stands up extremely well. The game features big name voice talent such as Kiefer Sutherland and Gary Oldman, and the soundtrack is immersive and fitting. The guns sound realistic and appropriately powerful - you can even hear the sounds of sizzling flesh after burning enemies with the flamethrower. If that sound doesn't draw you into the war, I'm not sure if anything will.  In the end, Call of Duty: World at War is a bit of an odd duck. It combines the new, successful multiplayer system of Modern Warfare with the old, familiar setting of World War II. Though WWII games are a dime a dozen, Call of Duty is still at the top for a reason. The campaign is varied and exciting, and can be played with up to three friends. The multiplayer is deep and addictive, and the new Nazi Zombie mode is surprisingly entertaining. The only major obstacle to enjoying this game for some is probably the setting. If you're absolutely sick of World War II, then you might end up forcing yourself not to enjoy this game. However, if you're a fan of first person shooters in the least, then World at War will provide an enthralling experience.",1,infinity ward released call duty modern warfare back developer met critical acclaim praise breaking away world war ii setting started bog revolutionary series made treyarchs decision bring fifth installment back historical time period much confusing mess success well call duty world war returns series roots good reminder world war ii games became popular first place tone gritty pace frantic action visceral world wars story split two different fronts ferocious jungle campaign pacific theatre retaliatory invasion russians eastern front thats right pesky normandy invasions time around pacific take role private miller united states marine corps take part island hopping campaign towards okinawa eastern front play private dimitri petrenko tasked pushing nazis russia marching berlin campaign paced exceptionally well missions fighting miller pacific youll switch play dimitri eastern europe stops campaign becoming stale keeping fresh exciting perhaps best part campaign sheer amount variety found missions first mission private petrenko example comes straight movie enemy gates narrowly surviving massacre nazi controlled stalingrad injured comrade make way enemy filled streets armed sniper rifle order assassinate german general addition sniper duels youll also burn enemy fortifications campaign well command tank enemy infested germany one memorable missions playing neither miller petrenko petty officer locke gunner pby catalina flying boat addition shooting japanese patrol boats merchant ships fighter planes youll try rescue american sailors stranded sea fleet decimated squadron kamikaze fighters mission really unique intensity ramps significantly japanese planes show ammo starts becoming scarce first person views planes interior well exceptional dialogue make mission much standard rail shooting experience although overall invigorating experience campaign faults notably annoying glitches example order finish one mission regroup squad mission wont end however backtrack half way level unstick one ai buddies grenade something obviously shouldnt make finished product minor glitches well little grenade symbol feet sometimes staying screen long explosion usually dont effect gameplay thus easily ignorable great campaign alone even greater friends world war allows play entire campaign three friends even turn competitive scoring much like halo add new layer depth playing friends cooperative mode world war everaddictive nazi zombies friends get fight neverending horde nazi zombies starting pistol game continues waves get progressively harder harder new guns available purchase hectic crazy although left dead heck lot fun nazi zombies isnt thing might find world wars multiplayer enjoyable treyarch took super addictive multiplayer system modern warfare still great classes perks prestige classes course technology present call duty wasnt around back treyarch make slight changes example instead able call helicopters getting killing streak bring attack dogs attack foes call artillery strikes bombard enemy positions essentials however get experience points killing enemies winning matches used unlock new powerful guns weapon accessories armor better perks prestige class returns well allowing return level reaching maximum level times dedicated getting top prepared put lot hours world war graphics world war stunning dazzling explosions lighting screen individual character models looking impressively detailed especially close banzai soldier jumps bayonet face animations spectacular well two soldiers dying way even blow individual body parts certain weapons like shotgun course extremely satisfying games audio also stands extremely well game features big name voice talent kiefer sutherland gary oldman soundtrack immersive fitting guns sound realistic appropriately powerful even hear sounds sizzling flesh burning enemies flamethrower sound doesnt draw war im sure anything end call duty world war bit odd duck combines new successful multiplayer system modern warfare old familiar setting world war ii though wwii games dime dozen call duty still top reason campaign varied exciting played three friends multiplayer deep addictive new nazi zombie mode surprisingly entertaining major obstacle enjoying game probably setting youre absolutely sick world war ii might end forcing enjoy game however youre fan first person shooters least world war provide enthralling experience

This game is super easy to run and it's easy to play smoothly on almost any computer (As long as you don't own a dinosaur for a PC.). One of the problems I had though was that I couldn't get my controller to work (At the time I was new to PC gaming so I was still more comfortable with a controller.). I don't know if there was something wrong on my end or the game just doesn't have the abillity to be played with a controller but this game has been out FOREVER and I think that it wouldn't be all that hard to add a patch to let you use a controller. Also this game is amazing when it comes to zombies. With the modding community you can have things in WaW Zombies that were only in future games. You also have an unlimited number of new maps and weapons to play on because of the awesome modding community.

Singleplayer has a really good story taking place on the Alies side of WWII which are the Americans and the Russians if you didnt know. But to sum it up the zombies mode is amazing, I could honestly do a whole review on it rather than putting it all here, it has custom zombies by the way so thats great.

"Best COD ever made, hands down. For those of you noobs who love CoD, but haven't played this need to know the following facts.  Pros:  - Better than any other Call of Duty game. (yes, that means Black Ops 1) - Most perfectly balanced Call of Duty ever made. Every single weapon class has its perks and drawbacks, nothing is OP or too strong. - Quickscoping is extremely difficult, so no OP snipers. - Absolutely fantastic multiplayer maps. - Equally fantastic DLC multiplayer maps. (as opposed to the normal, disappointing DLC you feel disappointed by) - The original game for Nazi zombies with the quintessential zombie maps. - Great Story. - ONLINE ISN'T DEAD!!! (05/10/2015)  Cons:  - Lack of servers.

Call of Duty WaW is a fantastic addition to the series. Classic WW2 shooter that won't dissapoint. The single player is enjoyable and made even more fun by cooperative mode. The Multiplayer is reminiscent of the original Call of Duty and the United Offensive expansion which is a very good thing. Tank combat is lacking but tanks are only in a few maps. Overall an enjoyable game if you can snag it during a sale. 7.5/10.,1,call duty waw fantastic addition series classic ww shooter wont dissapoint single player enjoyable made even fun cooperative mode multiplayer reminiscent original call duty united offensive expansion good thing tank combat lacking tanks maps overall enjoyable game snag sale

"After purchasing a gaming computer, this was one of the first games I downloaded. THE best purchase I have made on Steam. When World at War first came out, I only had an Xbox. I'd watch videos on YouTube of custom made zombie maps and I would weep silently as I was restricted to the stock &amp; DLC maps (which are still AMAZING). Call of Duty: World at War for PC gaming is everything I thought it would be and so much more.  Pros:  - Multiplayer is still popular, I'm normally playing in a server with between 14-40 people.  - Nazi Zombies, with hundreds of custom player made maps.   - Has 10 Prestiges (unlike CoD: 4) I find love that they added this for WaW. Through Prestiging, you can unlock 5 additional Custom Classes, for a total of 10 Customizable Classes.  - Singleplayer is incredibly fun and well done. I'm a sucker for WW2 games, so I admit that I am biased.  - Explosions and certain weapons will dismember enemies.  Cons:  - If you aren't with friends, or you haven't gone onto an online community to play Nazi Zombies/Custom NZ, you will more than likely not be able to find a game with a decent ping, which restricts you to SP Nazi Zombies. You can use cheats to help you out, if need be.  - Still has a few bugs here and there. The map Downfall occasionally crashes my game, and I will occasionally get kicked from servers upon loading new maps.  - Depending on the server, there will be hackers/try hards/cry babies/trolls. Enable Punkbuster and you should be okay (for hackers). I also tend to frequent the same 2 servers, which are usually monitored with an admin, and has a clan website where players can upload demos of suspected hackers.  - I find 20$ to be excessive for an 8 year old game (call me cheap idk), so I waited for it to go on sale and grabbed it for 10$  All in all, I have to give this a 9/10. The ability to play on customized zombie maps/mods allows you to spend hours trying out new maps or mods. I've been playing the Zombie Realism mod, which adds in a ranking system, custom classes, Prestige mode, weapon Challenges, and more. There aren't many 8 year old games that I can still have fun playing, but World at War is definitely one of them.

"Few years ago, we first heard that CS 1.6 is dead, some organizations have dismissed their CS - team, people screaming that the game is dead and we need to move to CS: GO. It seems that now it is not so! If you pay attention to the broadcast with IEM 6 WC, we see that CS 1.6 By Views prevzashla SC 2, not only is this game broke all past their records. So why CS 1.6 is dead? I beg to differ. According to spectators IEM 6 CS was the best in the tournament. I think CS 1.6 hardly died, she would die only if we want to do! As for CS: GO it grows, developers even began to read the 'Feedback', the game has changed a lot of things. Open Beta -version of the game was to be released after the new year, but I think the developers have not yet sufficiently satisfied with the result. As for the keys to the CS: GO, something I'm working on that would get a couple of the key for you guys! I will write how I succeed!",1,years ago first heard cs dead organizations dismissed cs team people screaming game dead need move cs go seems pay attention broadcast iem wc see cs views prevzashla sc game broke past records cs dead beg differ according spectators iem cs best tournament think cs hardly died would die want cs go grows developers even began read feedback game changed lot things open beta version game released new year think developers yet sufficiently satisfied result keys cs go something im working would get couple key guys write succeed

"Words cannot explain how great this game is. Upon the release of Half-Life, I was privileged enough to have this game (as well as Team Fortress Classic) come included with the game. I played both A LOT more then I did with Half-Life which I felt no need in playing again after beating it and the multiplayer left a lot to be desired. TFC brought me many great years of fun but like so many great games in the past, it just mysteriously died out and now I am anticipating the release of TFC2 next year. Counter-Strike, however, still has yet to die. Infact, it is a still ever growing community and easily the most popularly played FPS out today and still will be for quite some time, at least till CS 1.7 is released (if ever). I began playing this amazing game from the day the much anticipated Half-Life was released and haven't stopped since. I was what you would call a *pubmaster* for several years where I'd just walk into a pub and have fun pwning noobs but for pure enjoyment. The following years, a friend and I got into competitive play and joined CALeague. The rest, I guess you can say is history. I've played many seasons of CAL and yes, I've been out of CAL-O for several seasons (only played open for two seasons).  All in all, this game is still easily the best FPS out there even after 7 years. Pick it up, and you won't be disappointed. Do not be fooled about CS: Source, thinking it is better or that it is the future of Counter-Strike simply because it is newer. It's a really, really bad game.",1,words cannot explain great game upon release halflife privileged enough game well team fortress classic come included game played lot halflife felt need playing beating multiplayer left lot desired tfc brought many great years fun like many great games past mysteriously died anticipating release tfc next year counterstrike however still yet die infact still ever growing community easily popularly played fps today still quite time least till cs released ever began playing amazing game day much anticipated halflife released havent stopped since would call pubmaster several years id walk pub fun pwning noobs pure enjoyment following years friend got competitive play joined caleague rest guess say history ive played many seasons cal yes ive calo several seasons played open two seasons game still easily best fps even years pick wont disappointed fooled cs source thinking better future counterstrike simply newer really really bad game

"'Lock and Load.' 'Go go go!' 'Fire in the hole!' 'The bomb has been planted.' 'Counter-terrorists/terrorists Win.'  It is uncountable just how many times have these few sentences echoed in cybercafés across the world. For many, days were spent in front of the computer screen, manipulating the WASD keys with left hand and whirling the mouse with the right one. People yell and frown, they cheer and jeer as they team up their cyber-persona and pit them against another team. It doesn’t matter who won, who lost, who managed to kill to most of their opponents and who died the most, as everything will be scrambled up and reset when a new match begins. What is important is that, for those who are a part of the team, this computer game is their reality. These personas within the computer screen are their true identities. This is counter-strike.   Originally a modification (mod in short) made for Valve’s critically acclaimed Half-Life, Counter-Strike has gained much prominence since its initial launch. It is one of the first and definitely one of the most critically acclaimed multi-player computer games of all times. It is also the game used for many professional electronic sports competitions, such as ESEA League. Of course, this does not put Counter-Strike as a “professional only” game, as it has been enjoyed by many since its launch.  Getting started with Counter-strike is simple. You start off in one of the two teams: Counter-Terrorists or Terrorists. Before the round begins, you will have to purchase your own gun from the market, namely the famous AK47, M4A1, Desert Eagle, MP5, AWP and many more. Do not ask me why the counter-terrorists (namely the police) have to buy their own gun, and that they will have to go out with their lousy default colt pistols. Perhaps the government had some budget cuts and the SWATs have to buy their own guns. No one knows, but at least this will balance up the game. Also, you can equipment such as Highly-Explosive grenades, Flash-bangs (not recommend for beginners), smoke grenades, helmets and kevlars. You can also grab a defuse kit if you are playing on the side of the counter-terrorist, but normally we will steal that from dead teammates. Oh and you will be given a knife for free. Don’t worry about it, as most likely you use it to run instead of anything else.  The gameplay is fairly straightforward as well. There are quite a few number of game mods. The most frequently played ones are the Bomb Defusal maps, such as the all-time famous de_dust, the Hostage Rescue maps such as cs_assault, the VIP Escorting maps and the Kill Them All maps, such as the custom fy_iceworld and awp_map. Like all multi-player First Person Shooters, you will need good coordination and communication with your teammates if you want to win. Don’t worry about it though, because if you are new, just stick around and listen to what others have got to say. Just remember, you are not John Rambo, you only have 100 HP, and a stray bullet from a sniper rifle (AWP) will deal more damage than that.  As time press on, the mechanism of Counter-Strike became outdate. Of course, the legacy of Counter-Strike continues through its successors such as Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, Counter-Strike: Source, Counter-Strike Online (Asia only) and, the newest of all, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Throughout the years, Counter-Strike has evolved to become what it is today while its legend remains. Together with Half-Life and (maybe) Team Fortress Classic, Counter-Strike has not only helped Valve to thrive as a gaming company, but also defined what First Person Shooter should be.",1,lock load go go go fire hole bomb planted counterterroriststerrorists win uncountable many times sentences echoed cybercafs across world many days spent front computer screen manipulating wasd keys left hand whirling mouse right one people yell frown cheer jeer team cyberpersona pit another team doesnt matter lost managed kill opponents died everything scrambled reset new match begins important part team computer game reality personas within computer screen true identities counterstrike originally modification mod short made valves critically acclaimed halflife counterstrike gained much prominence since initial launch one first definitely one critically acclaimed multiplayer computer games times also game used many professional electronic sports competitions esea league course put counterstrike professional game enjoyed many since launch getting started counterstrike simple start one two teams counterterrorists terrorists round begins purchase gun market namely famous ak desert eagle mp awp many ask counterterrorists namely police buy gun go lousy default colt pistols perhaps government budget cuts swats buy guns one knows least balance game also equipment highlyexplosive grenades flashbangs recommend beginners smoke grenades helmets kevlars also grab defuse kit playing side counterterrorist normally steal dead teammates oh given knife free dont worry likely use run instead anything else gameplay fairly straightforward well quite number game mods frequently played ones bomb defusal maps alltime famous dedust hostage rescue maps csassault vip escorting maps kill maps custom fyiceworld awpmap like multiplayer first person shooters need good coordination communication teammates want win dont worry though new stick around listen others got say remember john rambo hp stray bullet sniper rifle awp deal damage time press mechanism counterstrike became outdate course legacy counterstrike continues successors counterstrike condition zero counterstrike source counterstrike online asia newest counterstrike global offensive throughout years counterstrike evolved become today legend remains together halflife maybe team fortress classic counterstrike helped valve thrive gaming company also defined first person shooter

"Brought this game solely for custom zombies and does not dissapoint in that respect, so many maps to choose from when you look around on the internet. Besides that the game ok, but not spectacular. The campaign is fairly forgettable apart from one or two good missions. The graphics aren't amazing compared to other shooters out there but you would expect that from a 8 year old game (at the time of writing this review) but as i stated early, i brought this for the zombies and with a huge array of custom content, it does not dissapoint!

On the hardest difficulty setting, you can have as many as THREE active grenade-warning-indicators at your location at a single time + infinite enemy respawn.

"I got this particular installation of Call of Duty for free when I bought Black Ops 2 for as far as I can remember.   It sat in my library for about a year, maybe a bit shorter maybe a little longer. Now, after installing and having played about half the campaign I can't help but be baffled at howmuch better this game feels while playing. It's FPS immersion at its best in my opinion.   Not to say I dont enjoy modern FPS games and their developments, but I went into playing this game thinking I was going to experience some mediocre storyline with Michael Bay inspired action movie characters + explosions. Well, the explosion part might still be true come to think of it. But other than that I absolutely love every aspect of this game. Nevermind the fact that it started the COD Zombie series which I've enjoyed across all of its installations.  Overall, I'd say this game is an easy 8/10 based solely on the campaign. I haven't touched the Multiplayer yet.",1,got particular installation call duty free bought black ops far remember sat library year maybe bit shorter maybe little longer installing played half campaign cant help baffled howmuch better game feels playing fps immersion best opinion say dont enjoy modern fps games developments went playing game thinking going experience mediocre storyline michael bay inspired action movie characters explosions well explosion part might still true come think absolutely love every aspect game nevermind fact started cod zombie series ive enjoyed across installations overall id say game easy based solely campaign havent touched multiplayer yet

"heres my analysis on this game: campaign: KILL THE BAD GUY!!! BONZAI!!! multiplayer:KILL THE BAD GUY!!! FOR MOTHER RUSSIA! zombies: the freaking reason i play any call of duty games. Its not just töten die Zombies!, its fun and has a good story, let me tell you about the begining (look it up, its recomended)  In the year 1939, the world was threatened by a second world war after hobolands chancellor and supreme dictator Snoop Dog rose to power. Dr. Sloth formed Group 420 as an international hoboland-led research team, and emerged as its head scientist. Sloth sought to use a mysterious new element, which he had named Element 420 , to improve the human condition by developing advanced trees, and enlisted Dr. Edward the train as his senior assistant rather than equal partner, much to his kindness. However, the group's goal immediately detoured due to a lack of Batman, and Sloth regretfully turned to making a contract with 'Dennys Wunderwaffle' Program to use 420 as a power source for deadly chivavas to help the Bad News Bears win the war. Sloth hoped that after the war, the generous funds and hobolands ultimate victory would put Group 420 in a much better position to help the shrek swamp.  10/10, would write that again",1,heres analysis game campaign kill bad guy bonzai multiplayerkill bad guy mother russia zombies freaking reason play call duty games tten die zombies fun good story let tell begining look recomended year world threatened second world war hobolands chancellor supreme dictator snoop dog rose power dr sloth formed group international hobolandled research team emerged head scientist sloth sought use mysterious new element named element improve human condition developing advanced trees enlisted dr edward train senior assistant rather equal partner much kindness however groups goal immediately detoured due lack batman sloth regretfully turned making contract dennys wunderwaffle program use power source deadly chivavas help bad news bears win war sloth hoped war generous funds hobolands ultimate victory would put group much better position help shrek swamp would write
"(Go read the TL:DR version at the end if you're too lazy to read this)  Singleplayer  There are two campaigns in this game, the American one (which mind you isn't that good) and the Russian one. Now, if I had to choose which is better I would go with the Russian one. I actually felt anger playing the Russian one, and that was only on the first mission. The Russian one is more dramatic than the American one, and I feel like the American one was poorly developed.  You see lots of people die on the American one and sure, that would be dramatic.... If you knew anything about them, which you don't. You just know that they're privates, corporals or whatever rank they are so it's not really that 'heart-breaking' when you see them die.  Now, when a guy in the Russian campaign (who was alive for the entire campaign) gets burned alive right infront of you, that's good story-telling.  Anyways, this game is good just for the story alone.  Multiplayer  Of course the community is toxic and full of kids that shouldn't even be playing CoD, but I won't rate it based on the community but I will rate it on the gameplay. This game plays differently from the other 'recent' ones in terms of multiplayer gameplay. In the multiplayer mode for WaW you actually need to take cover rather than charge in and kill everyone with your overpowered exo suit of edgelord.  In other words, the multiplayer is good, unless you don't like close-quarters combat in which case you should stick to the story alone.  Zombies  The zombies mode is pretty much one of the main reasons why people even buy the recent CoD games. The zombie mode itself has a story and it's addicting to destroy waves of zombies with a darned ray gun or wunderwaffle. A thompson can do the job too.  If you read this far, I give this game a rating of 9/10 with all of it's content.  And now for the fun facts and TL:DR version.  *It was more enjoyable to kill Nazis rather than Japanese. *It's kind of funny when Japaneses yell 'BANZAAAAAAAI!' *Multiplayer is full of toxic kiddies but it's enjoyable. *Zombie modes is good. *Just buy it.",1,go read tldr version end youre lazy read singleplayer two campaigns game american one mind isnt good russian one choose better would go russian one actually felt anger playing russian one first mission russian one dramatic american one feel like american one poorly developed see lots people die american one sure would dramatic knew anything dont know theyre privates corporals whatever rank really heartbreaking see die guy russian campaign alive entire campaign gets burned alive right infront thats good storytelling anyways game good story alone multiplayer course community toxic full kids shouldnt even playing cod wont rate based community rate gameplay game plays differently recent ones terms multiplayer gameplay multiplayer mode waw actually need take cover rather charge kill everyone overpowered exo suit edgelord words multiplayer good unless dont like closequarters combat case stick story alone zombies zombies mode pretty much one main reasons people even buy recent cod games zombie mode story addicting destroy waves zombies darned ray gun wunderwaffle thompson job read far give game rating content fun facts tldr version enjoyable kill nazis rather japanese kind funny japaneses yell banzaaaaaaai multiplayer full toxic kiddies enjoyable zombie modes good buy

" After 14 years of existence, this legendary game is still in the Steam top 10 most played multiplayers in the world .   While earning tons of money based on Counter-Strike sales, Valve shows its appreciation to the players that bought the game by still not maintaining it and treating it like it doesn't even exist. Even more, starting with February 2013, Valve has released a couple of minor updates for Counter-Strike which intentionally created problems for the game(suddenly stopping afterwards) so that the players would be forced to migrate to and buy CS:GO(which currently has and most probably will keep having major problems like fps drops and hit misdetection - problem present on all Source engine based multiplayers since 2004).  Congratulations, Valve .    Counting the players that migrated to or play the non-Steam version of Counter-Strike, the game still easily classifies itself even today in the top 5 most played multiplayers in the world .",1,years existence legendary game still steam top played multiplayers world earning tons money based counterstrike sales valve shows appreciation players bought game still maintaining treating like doesnt even exist even starting february valve released couple minor updates counterstrike intentionally created problems gamesuddenly stopping afterwards players would forced migrate buy csgowhich currently probably keep major problems like fps drops hit misdetection problem present source engine based multiplayers since congratulations valve counting players migrated play nonsteam version counterstrike game still easily classifies even today top played multiplayers world

"Please note: This Review is slightly subject to change mainly because at the time of this writing I have 70 hours.   The Campaign: While I have not finished it, so far it is quite nice. However sometimes the missions can become confusing. (Who is your enemy/ally, Where/What is your objective,etc.) Other than that, the campaign is quite fun and engaging.   The Zombies: This is probably the main reason why you want to buy the game. If you love zombies, BUY IT! The game gives you the four original maps to start (Nacht der Untoten, Verruckt, Shi no Numa, and Der Reise.) But that's just the start of it. There is also a HUGE modding community making CUSTOM maps for zombies. That's right. Thousands of zombie maps and mods that are ACTUALLY good. I downloaded one the other day that was a remake of Nacht Der Untoten and it was BEAUTIFULLY SCARY. I'll leave you with the thought of having thousands of awesome CUSTOM zombie maps and mods.   The Multiplayer: The multiplayer is fantastic, just like the zombies. This game nails the atmosphere of a WWII war PERFECTLY, and it really gets you going. It doesn't seem cool at first, but when you jump in and play it really becomes addicting. HOWEVER there are a few problems. First, there are some servers that are crouch only servers, which, while making battles SLIGHTLY more tactical, ruins the fast paced gameplay it's supposed to be. But remember only some servers do this. Also, the customization in this game is slightly lacking to that of other games it seems. Finally, there are SOME hacked servers and hackers. Hacked servers level you up very fast, which COULD you get you banned, but it's unlikely.   The Community: This community is great. As I said before the modding community is friendly, helpful, and amazing overall. The multiplayer is much better than other C.O.D games, as it has less ragers, hackers, and squeakers than other games. HOWEVER, since this game is 7 years old, there is not as many people playing it. ESPECIALLY vanilla zombies. Most people play multiplayer or custom zombie maps. So you might have a hard time finding a vanilla zombie match with 4 people.   Overall, the game is one of the best C.O.D games TO THIS DAY, as it has a wonderful community, pretty good graphics, scary zombies, and intense multiplayer, and a great campaign.   The Scores:   Campaign: 8/10  Zombies: 10/10  Multiplayer: 8/10  Overall: 8.5/10   If you even REMOTELY like Call of Duty, GET THIS GAME. There's VERY LITTLE reason you shouldn't get it.",1,please note review slightly subject change mainly time writing hours campaign finished far quite nice however sometimes missions become confusing enemyally wherewhat objectiveetc campaign quite fun engaging zombies probably main reason want buy game love zombies buy game gives four original maps start nacht der untoten verruckt shi numa der reise thats start also huge modding community making custom maps zombies thats right thousands zombie maps mods actually good downloaded one day remake nacht der untoten beautifully scary ill leave thought thousands awesome custom zombie maps mods multiplayer multiplayer fantastic like zombies game nails atmosphere wwii war perfectly really gets going doesnt seem cool first jump play really becomes addicting however problems first servers crouch servers making battles slightly tactical ruins fast paced gameplay supposed remember servers also customization game slightly lacking games seems finally hacked servers hackers hacked servers level fast could get banned unlikely community community great said modding community friendly helpful amazing overall multiplayer much better cod games less ragers hackers squeakers games however since game years old many people playing especially vanilla zombies people play multiplayer custom zombie maps might hard time finding vanilla zombie match people overall game one best cod games day wonderful community pretty good graphics scary zombies intense multiplayer great campaign scores campaign zombies multiplayer overall even remotely like call duty get game theres little reason shouldnt get

"October 12, 1942   My squad was in full retreat to the apartment building our base was in, the enemy was gunning us down with MGs while we where trying to reach the safe zone, men falling down beside me as they got hit by the shells and blown to bits and falling into craters, and getting their bodys pumped full of bullets. As we ran around the corner we rushed into the building. We reloaded and got geared up when we where given an order to rush the enemy. As we ran to the door shells started falling from the sky, the building was about to fall down when we started to rush out the doors to the enemy. As the germans shelled the h3ll out of us we took out the enemy infantry and blew up their tanks. Shells and bullets landed all over. As we got the end zone a shell landed right next to me.

"I received a low-threat prisoner, so I didn't pay much attention to him.  How wrong I was..  It was a normal, average day. The prisoners were eating their lunch.. then it happened.  He attacked from the shadows. Prisoner 'Leeroy jenkins' viciously started stabbing my guards with his plastic fork. It was 5 against one. He'll never win, I thought. He'll never escape, I thought. He'll never survive, I thought.  I thought wrong.  He managed to start a full-scale riot, him and his army of offenders. They broke all 7 of my steel doors with their bare fists, escaping into the yard. They were almost out. I quickly hired God-knows-how-many dog handlers, in a valiant effort to hold them back until the authorities get here. I managed to keep the tsunami of prisoners back, put the prison on lockdown and finally the armed police got here.  I did it, I stopped the riot.  But then I saw that one particular cell was empty.

"Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.  Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.  For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.  Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.  Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.  Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.  If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort.  Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.  Unlike other game types, Arms Race allows for respawns. It's the most chaotic and care-free mode in Global Offensive, with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible. It's a shame there are only two maps in Arms Race -- a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than PC.  If you have the option, playing the PC version is unquestionably the best way to experience Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

"This review is mainly to counter the huge positive review base for custom made mods: only a thumbs up because CoD:WaW delivered an entertaining WWII shooter that matched the ambience of the theme and war being depicted.   First, the biggest problem with custom mods, the lack of centralization of all of them. There is only a handful of them that are actually consolidated in a map downloaded on one of the official sites where you can download mods for zombies. How does that effect you? First of all, if you even get far enough to finding the right mod everyone is playing, or most popular that week, you'll have to wait on end to get people to join or find someone who is playing the same exact mod. The second largest problem is the way mods are loaded in WaW. Say you refreshed the server lists of all the people hosting a game, and you finally see someone hosting a mod you have, you now have to back to the main menu, click mods, then click load mod. After that, WaW will briefly restart itself. All of this can tack about five seconds if you are really fast, and maybe 10 seconds if you're new to the whole thing. Those five or ten seconds will make the difference between the time that lobby is empty, and the time the lobby is full, or you get the message, game is no longer available. It is extremely frustrating as, you'll be waiting another 15-30 minutes just waiting for somone to host a lobby with the same mod loaded, or you may be hosting your own only to be waiting for ever. One of the worst parts about all of this, is MOST mods include MODERN weapons! This is the biggest grip I had with custom zombies, I bought this game to play authentic WWII Guns, but it seems every popular modded server will have a modern weapon in it, and you have to use it for the late game part of the levels if you want to be efficient. Actually, do the previous reason mentioned, I strictly play vanilla maps, and they are hard to come by. Its true, if you are expecting to play vanilla map, the percentage or chances of you finding a lobby of someone playing vanilla map are worst than finding someone with the same mod as you. Its really hard to find someone just hosting the plain ol vanilla maps. To make matters worst, hackers and those users who think their cool loading this 'mod menu' hack into the game to give ammunition and gun cheats just ruins the whole experience as it causes terrible de-sync issues with the server, so you'll game will freeze up and you'll be dropped from the match. That is the last reason as well, CONNECTION IN THIS GAME IS HORRIBLE. GOOD luck finding a game where you won't be dropped, what is worst than a host who uses mod menu? Constantly, de-dyncing, lagging, and dropping in the middle of the game. Its is terrible and ruins the whole experience. The multiplayer side is quite active, but the elites of the multiplayer mode are the epitome of camping, hand-eye cordination, and literally picking the most unusally spots to snipe you from. Almost any weapon in this game can one-hit kill you, so multiplayer is all about eye-recognization and speed. Be the fastest to see and shoot or you'll never get a kill (Its EXTREMELY hard to see enemies because their uniforms literally blend into the environment) Unless you are really good at spotting or camping really well, the multiplayer mode will be as frustrating as playing on a vanilla or modded zombies game.   Good luck maximizing your rank in multiplayer if you are buying this game in 2016 lol.",1,review mainly counter huge positive review base custom made mods thumbs codwaw delivered entertaining wwii shooter matched ambience theme war depicted first biggest problem custom mods lack centralization handful actually consolidated map downloaded one official sites download mods zombies effect first even get far enough finding right mod everyone playing popular week youll wait end get people join find someone playing exact mod second largest problem way mods loaded waw say refreshed server lists people hosting game finally see someone hosting mod back main menu click mods click load mod waw briefly restart tack five seconds really fast maybe seconds youre new whole thing five ten seconds make difference time lobby empty time lobby full get message game longer available extremely frustrating youll waiting another minutes waiting somone host lobby mod loaded may hosting waiting ever one worst parts mods include modern weapons biggest grip custom zombies bought game play authentic wwii guns seems every popular modded server modern weapon use late game part levels want efficient actually previous reason mentioned strictly play vanilla maps hard come true expecting play vanilla map percentage chances finding lobby someone playing vanilla map worst finding someone mod really hard find someone hosting plain ol vanilla maps make matters worst hackers users think cool loading mod menu hack game give ammunition gun cheats ruins whole experience causes terrible desync issues server youll game freeze youll dropped match last reason well connection game horrible good luck finding game wont dropped worst host uses mod menu constantly dedyncing lagging dropping middle game terrible ruins whole experience multiplayer side quite active elites multiplayer mode epitome camping handeye cordination literally picking unusally spots snipe almost weapon game onehit kill multiplayer eyerecognization speed fastest see shoot youll never get kill extremely hard see enemies uniforms literally blend environment unless really good spotting camping really well multiplayer mode frustrating playing vanilla modded zombies game good luck maximizing rank multiplayer buying game lol

I recommend this game for many reasons. First this game is playable on windows xp or higher. Second i love the custom zombies and the ability of modding the weapons for it. The game is still very alive on multiplayer and it is somewhat fair because of the people who have aimbot. There are thousands of servers including the modded maps and game types. Although it is still possible for people to get cracked versions it is faster and easier to get the boughten version. The only thing that is bad is that not enough people are playing Nazi Zombies.

First please read the review because there are a lot of fanboys who downvote all negative ones just because you want me to think perfectly of this game!  Well first of all i wanna say i dont have much to say other than this game is amazing i have played it my entire life but not the steam version a pirated version and please dont hate me for that but the most stable version of this game is pirate version wanna know the reasons why? ok fine here they are: 1.CL_flushentitypacket error which is extremely annoying given the fact that it will lagg you out and it cant be fixed because most of the servers are against the fix and usually that fix doesnt even work. While that error occurs on pirated version too it occurs really rarely while on steam version it doesnt stop the whole damn game and it is either the server that will kick you for using that fix or VAC that will kick you if you are lucky and ban you and you arent even using the third party software!!! its a console FLIPPING COMMAND!!! 2.There are a ton of servers that have a virus that will rebind all of your keys to join their server once you join the server for the first time and honestly i dont know how will this benefit either the owner of the server or you because you cant even play the server normally you will just reconnect all over again when you try to do something and in all honesty if you do such thing on your server ♥♥♥♥ you and i hope you get cancer. But you might be thinking how is this connected to not buying this game? well simple and i have 2 reasons for that. First reason is that why do you want to spend money on a game that has this type of issue and second of all the reason why this is a biggie is that in pirated version of the game you can change your binds and it will all save but unlike the steam version the 'Synchronizing feature' will save stuff but if you change the binds it will come back because people who use this exploit can work their way around it and trust me you will encounter a lot of servers like that. But trust me i dont hate this game in fact this is the game that got me into pc gaming back in 2004 but is it worth it buying a game that doesnt benefit you in any way as a legal version? of course not but its not me thinking that this game is ♥♥♥♥ in fact its evolutionary its perfect and i have spent 1000+ hours outside of steam version and i gotta say i have been getting a lot less errors and a lot less ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t messages from vac for me trying to fix this error and a lot less problems than i had with the LEGAL VERSION THAT SHOULD BE MORE OF A QUALITY THAN THE ILLEGAL VERSION!. And im not promoting piracy in fact i think its lame but this is the game that should be pirated because it doesnt offer anything good in legal version in fact it downgrades a lot but when there are 50000 people that are hidden off your charts of cs 1.6 just because they wanna play normally and pirate the game there is something seriously wrong with the legal version and i really dont recommend buying this its the same as the pirated version but with more game breaking stuff! ,-1,first please read review lot fanboys downvote negative ones want think perfectly game well first wanna say dont much say game amazing played entire life steam version pirated version please dont hate stable version game pirate version wanna know reasons ok fine clflushentitypacket error extremely annoying given fact lagg cant fixed servers fix usually fix doesnt even work error occurs pirated version occurs really rarely steam version doesnt stop whole damn game either server kick using fix vac kick lucky ban arent even using third party software console flipping command ton servers virus rebind keys join server join server first time honestly dont know benefit either owner server cant even play server normally reconnect try something honesty thing server hope get cancer might thinking connected buying game well simple reasons first reason want spend money game type issue second reason biggie pirated version game change binds save unlike steam version synchronizing feature save stuff change binds come back people use exploit work way around trust encounter lot servers like trust dont hate game fact game got pc gaming back worth buying game doesnt benefit way legal version course thinking game fact evolutionary perfect spent hours outside steam version gotta say getting lot less errors lot less messages vac trying fix error lot less problems legal version quality illegal version im promoting piracy fact think lame game pirated doesnt offer anything good legal version fact downgrades lot people hidden charts cs wanna play normally pirate game something seriously wrong legal version really dont recommend buying pirated version game breaking stuff

"&lt;this 'review' only mentions the singleplayer and coop aspect of the game&gt;  Holy hell, I seriously cannot play this game again after playing BF4.

Everything from bloody screens, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ flinching effect, dumb or op AI, granade spam, simple/poorly designed levels, no fov slider, tons of invisible walls, quick time events, and seemingly infinitely respawning enemies make this game annoying to play.

The game is more enjoyable when you aren't the only competent soldier on the campagin.

"The first FPS/Game I played on PC and to be honest those years playing CS1.6 (5+years) were simply AMAZING !  At the time the gameplay was perfect ! the game was really easy to handle and understand, the graphisme ? When it came out it was really good and enough, then the game never grew up and we never had patchs / new versions. But it was still fine as long as we could all developpe our skill and create new strats.  We got a lot of mods like zombie deathmatch gungame jail and for me the best mods Hide'N'Seek, Kz, Deathrun etc...  To be honest those years were truly a pleasure to play.

"This and Cod4 are without a doubt my two favorite releases in the franchise's history. Cod4 brought new life to fps mp and then cod:waw went ahead and introduced zombies which I still go back to frequently this many years later. I owned the non-steam version of the game quite a while before I got it on steam so I have a lot more hours than steam shows- For about a year I played this game with my friends for 6-8 hours straight at least once a week. It was the last cod that didn't charge you for the DLC the console users had to buy and the modding community, at least the zombie side of it, is still alive and well. If you have a few friends that want to do some zombies you will have plenty of content from the community to keep you busy for a long long time. It's well worth the $20 price tag.",1,cod without doubt two favorite releases franchises history cod brought new life fps mp codwaw went ahead introduced zombies still go back frequently many years later owned nonsteam version game quite got steam lot hours steam shows year played game friends hours straight least week last cod didnt charge dlc console users buy modding community least zombie side still alive well friends want zombies plenty content community keep busy long long time well worth price tag

"Call of Duty: World at War is a great game. The campaign is engaging and replayable, the multiplayer is fun and enjoyable, and the zombies mode that was introduced from this game that is still in the newer Treyarch titles is a fun game to play with friends.  Pros- [Campaign]- Good story and characters, engages you, challenges you, and is only the lead into the stories of BO1 and 2. [MP]- People still play this almost 9 year old game. [MP]- Guns are varying, meaning you aren't going to get killed by one gun and one only (but beware of PPsh users) [ZM]- Simple and easy to learn. [ZM]- Fun for co-op or online. [ZM]- Custom zombies. [Campaign]- This is a personal opinion, but this game is gorey-er than other COD campaigns, and I think it impoves immersion  Cons- [Campaign]- Although I said its challenging, sometimes it's too much so. [Campaign]- The Pacific Theatre gets boring towards the end, and you almost want it to end there. [MP]- Juggernaut. Enough said. [MP]- Anymore, most servers are not vanilla, meaning it will probably be modded in some way. [ZM]- It gets repetitive after a while, due to simplicity.  Final Verdict- Campaign- 8.75/10. It's good, but not amazing. Multiplayer- 9/10. Probably the best multiplayer in a COD game. Zombies- 9.5/10. The second best Zombies mode so far, only behind Black Ops 1. Overall [Average of all scores]- 9.11/10. My favorite COD, and to many others one of the best in the series.",1,call duty world war great game campaign engaging replayable multiplayer fun enjoyable zombies mode introduced game still newer treyarch titles fun game play friends pros campaign good story characters engages challenges lead stories bo mp people still play almost year old game mp guns varying meaning arent going get killed one gun one beware ppsh users zm simple easy learn zm fun coop online zm custom zombies campaign personal opinion game goreyer cod campaigns think impoves immersion cons campaign although said challenging sometimes much campaign pacific theatre gets boring towards end almost want end mp juggernaut enough said mp anymore servers vanilla meaning probably modded way zm gets repetitive due simplicity final verdict campaign good amazing multiplayer probably best multiplayer cod game zombies second best zombies mode far behind black ops overall average scores favorite cod many others one best series

"  Update to my review with some shameless advertising 05/10/2016:   Hey readers. I am now hosting a server on CS 1.6 where you can play and enjoy the fun experiences I did back in the day.   Map rotations vary from Vehicle, Aim, Surf, Knife, Defusal, and Hostage maps! IP Address: 173.199.73.78:27025     Review 21/10/2014:   I've played this game since I was around 6 years old back in 2002 and it still makes me laugh and have fun whenever I launch it to this very day. Over 12 years of endless entertainment. No other game on this planet has given me more entertainment and enjoyment than Counter-Strike 1.6 has and I doubt no game ever will.  Reason i've only got 38 hours here is because I no longer use the account I originally played cs 1.6 on.   func_vehicle is what makes this Counter Strike game the best out of all the others in the franchise.  Find a server that has car maps or maps with func_vehicle entities and you will have endless fun running over teammates and enemies in all kinds of hilarious and goofy vehicles not giving a care in the world.  You can drive a fork with a meatball on the end of it. Do i need to say more?  Mods on this game are amazing too. There is a mod where you can catch pokemon, level them up, train them and use their skills. Call of Duty mod that is suprisingly better than cod its self, Warcraft mods, zombie mods, basebuilder and so on...  There is even a map for the jailbreak gamemode that has driveable snowmobiles.   1337/10  Leet crew 5 lyf  Kicks csgo's ♥♥♥ by a mile. I forgot how good wallbanging is in this game.  P.S - CS 1.6 is the only Counter Strike game where you can headshot with a knife or buy Riot Shields. Enjoy!

"Note : This is for Battlefield 3. But unable to review non steam games :-) Quickly though COD WOW was the best COD. Anyway took a few games to get into as the maps can be much larger, but all in all it's classic BF. Stu will remember BF more than most and it should be noted that BF2142 may be getting an update (this was the best of the BF series), but anyway you should buy BF3. So much variety from the smaller Paris underground battles to the large scale invasions. The graphics are top notch and on my humble system can play maxed out at 1280x1040. It currently crashes on Ultra, but once fixed I'll pimp up from high. This wipes the floor with COD if you prefer teamwork and an infinite amount of posibilities. The one player is ok so far and will update once finished, but the hook is MP, with plenty of maps and next month the original BF2 maps will be released (which I got in the version from Game). 32 players pushing up a street whilst working as a team is simply brilliant.",1,note battlefield unable review non steam games quickly though cod wow best cod anyway took games get maps much larger classic bf stu remember bf noted bf may getting update best bf series anyway buy bf much variety smaller paris underground battles large scale invasions graphics top notch humble system play maxed x currently crashes ultra fixed ill pimp high wipes floor cod prefer teamwork infinite amount posibilities one player ok far update finished hook mp plenty maps next month original bf maps released got version game players pushing street whilst working team simply brilliant

First off, you'll never get bored of zombies as there are so much maps to pick from (there are websites with hundreds of maps).. literally it's endless.If you can get a few friends to buy it too and get all the same maps, it is just endless hours of fun.   However i didn't think much of the multiplayer side of this game as i expected it to be like the console - full of hackers and no one playing. Wow I was wrong!   I went in to expect no one online. Pressed refresh and hunders of severs and I had the option to filter it and only show servers that aren't modded. I even saw a few servers full of 40+ people playing! (Yep! 40+ people playing in the one match of TDM and on the tiny maps-- IT'S JUST CHAOS in a good way).   Seriously, buy this game for Campaign, Multiplayer and Zombies! Worth all of your money and all of your hours! Really fun and addictive. This is the game where Call of Duty was at it's best and if it wants to return to that, just remaster this f***ing game!

"This game is absolutely incredible, even though it is almost eight years old at the time of posting this. In my opinion, it is the best COD game created, and Treyarch is the best company Activision has worked with. I can't find any fatal flaws in the game. If all you want is zombies and campaign, go right ahead and get this, but I can't find any lobbies that aren't full of hackers on the multiplayer. Also, this game doesn't really need 256 MB VRAM, as I can play the Zombies maps on 128. However, the campaign certainly needs it in some spots.   Pros: -ZOMBIES -Custom zombies -Nostalgia -Only 20 bucks -Relatively low system requirements  Cons: -Games are a little glitchy (E.g. instadown in zombies, not getting downed when you should in zombies) -Crashes when you try to change resolution and some other graphics settings (Just have to modify config file) -Hackers in multiplayer -Lose Jug when hit with Wunderwaffe (Minor complaint)  Note that there are soooo many more pros, but those were the only cons I could think of at the time of posting this.",1,game absolutely incredible even though almost eight years old time posting opinion best cod game created treyarch best company activision worked cant find fatal flaws game want zombies campaign go right ahead get cant find lobbies arent full hackers multiplayer also game doesnt really need mb vram play zombies maps however campaign certainly needs spots pros zombies custom zombies nostalgia bucks relatively low system requirements cons games little glitchy eg instadown zombies getting downed zombies crashes try change resolution graphics settings modify config file hackers multiplayer lose jug hit wunderwaffe minor complaint note soooo many pros cons could think time posting

"Ok Counter Strike. Where do I even begin?  This is where it all started. I have always been a 1.6 player. My old accoint that had over 7,500 hours on it was lost, due to me forgetting the password. I took a break for a couple of years, realizing that CS was slowly taking away my life. Well, I am back, and would of never thought to be in this position. I tried CS:GO, but... eh. The ranks and skins and little kids kind of ruined it for me. Don't get me wrong, it's a great game, but doesn't neccesarily give me the true feeling of Counter Strike. Went back into this game a few years later, and realize the community is filled with nudity, the game has people raging in different laguages, and... hackers. That was until I found servers that were english; servers with admins watching it. And I said to myself, 'Oh ♥♥♥♥.

"Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter game from Valve, the first of the Counter-Strike series.  Counter-Strike is a round based game where you play as counter terrorist or play as terrorist. As a counter terrorist, your task is to prevent the terrorist from planting a bomb and detonate it or rescue a captured hostages and lead them to the hostage rescue zone, while the terrorist team has to do the opposite. Weapons has hard recoil so you can't just spray and pray, short burst fire can save you in critical situation. Before the round begins, you can and need to buy weapons and equipments with money, you get money by winning the round or killing the enemy team. This type of gameplay encourages team work.

"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.  I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.  I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,",1,experience game type review saying things like great gameplay suit something ive experienced counterstrike go remember back friends house playing game didnt know name game internet find weeks passed another friend came didnt computer brought disc game told one best games moment knew going game saw friends house saw counterstrike logo filled gamegasm happy dont remember day happy like back journey started playing hardcore made friends clans involved communities even made two counterstrike first game played competitively whole experience playing public servers maybe servers mods fun playing competitively made intense stressful pleasant way ofcourse shooters days try different advanced way sometimes simple games like counterstrike ones live day also plenty mods keep attention game gameplay simple defend counterterrorist attack terrorist plant bomb save hostages ct sure already know doubt gamers havent heard know gameplay counterstrike sharing experience wish could find cs anthology account ive lost since decided going buy game go thousand hours played still play time time day brings back many great memories sometimes even stumble upon people ive played years ago think counterstrike changed gaming major way wouldnt many games like today game wouldnt exist sure many people already played games like csgo never roots doubt play hour much simple differs lot opinion csgo modern games glad lived golden era shooters id rate itd ofcourse

"Anyone considering getting this game at this point, because the price has come down to 10 bucks... don't. On a functional level, it's not playable. The control scheme is not for most people, and you will cause yourself carpal tunnel syndrome from spinning the mouse in rapid circles while holding a button to charge up. That's if it starts up. And considering it's been abandoned by the creators, there's no bug support if it won't. Beyond the technical issues, the plot and styling of this game is in some of the most poor taste I've ever seen, from fake Chinese speach clearly thought up by white people to blatant homophobia I get the uncomfortable feeling isn't actually joking, it really has all the most reprehensible behavior you'd expect from fratboys. If this crap was done in the guise of joking, it'd be comparable to if a standup comedian delivered a KKK-grade black joke and then spent five minutes yelling 'ISN'T THAT FUNNY!?' at an audience that clearly doesn't agree. If you want a game that's playable or has a well-designed, non-offensive story, this one probably isn't for you. If you have no taste, waste ten bucks and see if it even runs for you. For my money, I'd be better off burning 10 bucks for warmth or literally eating it. It was on sale for $2.50 (I believe 90% off at the time) when I got it and I still want my money back.",-1,anyone considering getting game point price come bucks dont functional level playable control scheme people cause carpal tunnel syndrome spinning mouse rapid circles holding button charge thats starts considering abandoned creators theres bug support wont beyond technical issues plot styling game poor taste ive ever seen fake chinese speach clearly thought white people blatant homophobia get uncomfortable feeling isnt actually joking really reprehensible behavior youd expect fratboys crap done guise joking itd comparable standup comedian delivered kkkgrade black joke spent five minutes yelling isnt funny audience clearly doesnt agree want game thats playable welldesigned nonoffensive story one probably isnt taste waste ten bucks see even runs money id better burning bucks warmth literally eating sale believe time got still want money back

Tidiest Modeler I've played with so far. Not many bells and whistles however ( I don't think you can even paint outside of just using brushes for sculpting).  Silo has a very clean and polished interface making it easy to see what you're working with more so than other modeling suites and anyone with basic knowedge should be able to find their way around easy enough.  Random instabiliiy issues on machines not running 64 bit Win ~ Silo 2 was not practical for me until I upgraded even considering it's adjustable autosave feature.  Fun to play in and useful for creating rough basic shapes. Beyond that I trust the exported Obj files to the (still) free Sculptris or Curvy 3D.,1,tidiest modeler ive played far many bells whistles however dont think even paint outside using brushes sculpting silo clean polished interface making easy see youre working modeling suites anyone basic knowedge able find way around easy enough random instabiliiy issues machines running bit win silo practical upgraded even considering adjustable autosave feature fun play useful creating rough basic shapes beyond trust exported obj files still free sculptris curvy

"Buggy and frankly the missions suck. Stupid AI is constantly putting friendly npcs in front of you for you to shoot.  At one point I lost my weapon due to an attack from a dog. The notice that the dog attack remained on the screen and I could no longer pick up any weapon. Aborting the mission meant going back to the very beginning instead of that particular phase.  I recall playing COD (the very first one) a long long time ago and it was with a fond remembrance that I bought this game. Unfortunately the player in solo mode is too tied to his AI squad mates who are stupider than dirt. The graphics might be better than the very first COD, but not by much.   I'm sure that this is great in coop or multiplayer, but I don't play those modes and they have no appeal for me. If I want to play with someone I'll do it face to face thanks muchly.   This was just not a good purchase as far as I'm concerned.

"Am I really writing a recommendation for this game?  Counter-Strike  or CS 1.6  is a classic game which started off as a Half-Life 1 mod way back in late 1999, and was later sold in 2000 which required both Half-Life 1 and the game itself. Where as now, you only need the game itself on Steam.   Counter-Strike was one of the biggest multiplayer FPS games ever made, due to it being playable on many computers, and just an overall really fun game. It has no doubt made a huge impact on the world of FPS. Especially in the competitive scene such as e-sports where 1.6 is still being played today.  However, it has aged. A lot. Especially in comparison to Counter-Strike: Source. So a lot of maps are quite spacious and don't look as realistic as many would expect to todays standards.   I actually prefer CS:S over this game as I just like the feel of it more.  I honestly don't know why I'm reviewing this game, as I'm sure everyone on my friends list here has played it. But just incase you're that one odd person out that for osme reason hasn't played it - try it out, and see whether you like it or not.

"In my opinion, this game good, but not great.  Gameplay- It's your average CoD shooter where you soak up an ♥♥♥ ton of bullets, but if you wait, you're fine. CoD 4 has great action, but WaW feels like a throw back to CoD 1,2 and 3. The gameplay can get stale and at times you get really bored if not with friends. Also, unlike the MW campaigns, I don't remember any one. No one was really as awesome as Soap or Price, but there was Reznov, who is badass, but not as much in this game then in Black Ops 1 and 2. 7/10 for gameplay  Multiplayer- THE MULTIPLAYER IS ♥♥♥♥ED AND FILLED WITH HAXERS. Well. you can get into a legit server, but usually someone is hosting the server, so there might be mods ahead. 6/10-for MP right now (2015), not in 2008-2010  Zombies- This, my friends, is the best part of this whole game. I love the zombies mode! It's because you can get custom maps and guns that are from other CoDs or just custom guns. Although, the 4 standard maps aren't bad, infact they are pretty good, they start to get boring, but with PPSH, nothing gets boring. If there was any reason to buy this game, then it's for zombies. 9/10-for Zombies  Is it worth $20? Well, depends. Some people may have loved every thing about this game and don't care about hackers and modders in MP. If your one of those people than sure! Go ahead, but for poeple, like myself, that only want to play zombies mode with custom maps, it's not worth it. I would rather wait for a god damn season sale than pay $20 for this.  Final Score- 7.33/10 ",1,opinion game good great gameplay average cod shooter soak ton bullets wait youre fine cod great action waw feels like throw back cod gameplay get stale times get really bored friends also unlike mw campaigns dont remember one one really awesome soap price reznov badass much game black ops gameplay multiplayer multiplayer ed filled haxers well get legit server usually someone hosting server might mods ahead mp right zombies friends best part whole game love zombies mode get custom maps guns cods custom guns although standard maps arent bad infact pretty good start get boring ppsh nothing gets boring reason buy game zombies zombies worth well depends people may loved every thing game dont care hackers modders mp one people sure go ahead poeple like want play zombies mode custom maps worth would rather wait god damn season sale pay final score
"Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter video game developed by Valve Corporation. It was initially developed and released as a Half-Life modification by Minh 'Gooseman' Le and Jess 'Cliffe' Cliffe in 1999, before Le and Cliffe were hired and the game's intellectual property acquired. Counter-Strike was first released by Valve on the Microsoft Windows platform in 2000. The game later spawned a franchise, and is the first installment in the Counter-Strike series. Several remakes and Ports of Counter-Strike have been released on the Xbox console, as well as OS X and Linux.   Set in various locations around the globe, players assume the roles of members of combating teams that include counter-terrorists and terrorists. During each round of gameplay, the two teams are tasked with defeating the other by the means of either achieving the map's objectives, or else killing all of the enemy combatants. Each player may customize their arsenal of weapons and accessories at the beginning of every match, with currency being earned after the end of each round.",1,counterstrike firstperson shooter video game developed valve corporation initially developed released halflife modification minh gooseman le jess cliffe cliffe le cliffe hired games intellectual property acquired counterstrike first released valve microsoft windows platform game later spawned franchise first installment counterstrike series several remakes ports counterstrike released xbox console well os x linux set various locations around globe players assume roles members combating teams include counterterrorists terrorists round gameplay two teams tasked defeating means either achieving maps objectives else killing enemy combatants player may customize arsenal weapons accessories beginning every match currency earned end round

"The atmosphere is dark, gritty, and somber. A cloak of melancholy engulfs the battlefield. People absorb bullets as though the ammo is water. 90% of guns have the appearance of thier airsoft equivalents, and the effictiveness is identical. Hackers, though prevalent on console, are nonexistant in this PC version. Attack dogs are more deadly than a PTRS sniper rifle, and the sky seems to rain explosives, whether it be frag, sticky, or satchel charges.

Call of duty 5 or World At War is one of my perosnal bests of the call of duty franchise this cannot be extended to the newer titles. but do not let the bad reputation of later installments put you off this game. World at war also comes with four epic dlc's which come with the game at purchase this title if baught on console with all map packs would come to a total of about £40 so this is definatly worth buying as a pose to colsoles. Also with the pc version of the game comes Custom zombies extending the limitations of the offical maps keeping customers engaged for hours on end. The campaign to this title is also complex even for a call of duty games with likable and relatable characters this will keep you engaged for hours as the campaign is also not easy to complete depending on your mode of play. Multiplayer for this title even holds up in the standards of 2014's competative market. Also one of the side games for this title Nazi Zombies is fun and engaging and has a complex and intreaging storyline which is followed up in other installments that even rivals the storyline of the main campaign this game is definatly worth the buy and i give it a solit 10/10.,1,call duty world war one perosnal bests call duty franchise cannot extended newer titles let bad reputation later installments put game world war also comes four epic dlcs come game purchase title baught console map packs would come total definatly worth buying pose colsoles also pc version game comes custom zombies extending limitations offical maps keeping customers engaged hours end campaign title also complex even call duty games likable relatable characters keep engaged hours campaign also easy complete depending mode play multiplayer title even holds standards competative market also one side games title nazi zombies fun engaging complex intreaging storyline followed installments even rivals storyline main campaign game definatly worth buy give solit

"Well I guess since I have 117 hours clocked into this game *cough cough* steam bug *cough cough* I am obligated to write a review for this game. So this game is most definetly timeless as it is basically super smash bros melee to Counter-Strike:Source/Counter-Strike Global Offensive's super smash bros brawl. This game is unique as when you die you don't respawn until the next round meaning that your team can lose by having all of it's members die. As well, you need to buy your weapons or take them from the bodies of your enemies instead of just finding them scattered across the battlefield like other games of it's time did. Today the game can seem a bit outdated with a lack of ragdoll physics making aerial deaths look weird and unnatural as well as the obvious outdated graphics which can be 'fixed' with a hd patch that just looks weird and unnatural compaired to games made at the time of the patch's creation (2003). Overall I would recommend this game if you buy the retail copy or if they fixed the bug that is the only reason why I have logged 117 hours into the game.",1,well guess since hours clocked game cough cough steam bug cough cough obligated write review game game definetly timeless basically super smash bros melee counterstrikesourcecounterstrike global offensives super smash bros brawl game unique die dont respawn next round meaning team lose members die well need buy weapons take bodies enemies instead finding scattered across battlefield like games time today game seem bit outdated lack ragdoll physics making aerial deaths look weird unnatural well obvious outdated graphics fixed hd patch looks weird unnatural compaired games made time patchs creation overall would recommend game buy retail copy fixed bug reason logged hours game

"Quake was the first game I was ever really addicted to and focused a big portion of my time on for months or years at a time. Counter-Strike was the second - and easily more addicting. There's a reason that I still compare every multi-player shooter experience back to original Counter-Strike, to this day. There's a reason I still compare every server community to this (Counter-Strike servers each had their own community and personality and people truly got to know each other back in the day, compared to these days, where a server is just something you're automatically dumped into and feels like every other server).  Despite many iterations, nothing quite plays like the original. It's not hard to see why there are still 10,000 to 60,000 people playing this  at any one time on any day , fifteen years after launch and why it is always in the top ten games currently being played on all of Steam.  This is where it all started. Without this, there's an entire genre of shooter and multi-player that just vanishes. The original days of Counter-Strike remain the most enjoyable gaming experiences of my entire life. It's unlikely that will ever be trumped.",1,quake first game ever really addicted focused big portion time months years time counterstrike second easily addicting theres reason still compare every multiplayer shooter experience back original counterstrike day theres reason still compare every server community counterstrike servers community personality people truly got know back day compared days server something youre automatically dumped feels like every server despite many iterations nothing quite plays like original hard see still people playing one time day fifteen years launch always top ten games currently played steam started without theres entire genre shooter multiplayer vanishes original days counterstrike remain enjoyable gaming experiences entire life unlikely ever trumped

And they aren't all spawn a billion zombies on top of your head and see how long you can survive with a Pack-A-Punched Ray Gun. Most of them are actually very very detailed importing textures and weapons into the map from other games in the franchise and completely other games!

"Call of Duty: World at War. The last game before all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC ports of the Call of Duty series. World at War (WaW) is the fifth iteration in the arcade shooter series that brings WWII elements in the COD universe. WAW is Made by Treyarch a company that has made titles such as 'Call of Duty: 2' and 'Call of duty: 3', so if you have played those you're in for a similar experience just much more shiny. The COD series also has another developer (Infinity Ward) that switches off on each of the series's games. WAW brings a whole new part of the series. A 4-Player cooperative game-mode named 'Nazi Zombies'. The new experience compiles intuitive gameplay like finding the best parts of a level to kill the undead or find out what weapons do the most damage.The campaign is 5-8 hours of Shooting mindless enemies on set pieces arranging from the heart of Russia to Nazi trenches. The multiplayer is class based with a perk system and customizable weapons. If you manage to get a certain amount of kills in a row you earn special kill-streaks. 3 kills is a UAV, 5 kills is an Artillery Strike, and 8 kills in a row you call in dogs to rip your enemies apart. Overall Call of Duty: World at War is a great buy if you like shooting up hordes of zombies all night with your friends. Or if you want to have a good time killing your way to the top in the leaderboards on multiplayer. Either way your going to have a good time with this game.",1,call duty world war last game pc ports call duty series world war waw fifth iteration arcade shooter series brings wwii elements cod universe waw made treyarch company made titles call duty call duty played youre similar experience much shiny cod series also another developer infinity ward switches seriess games waw brings whole new part series player cooperative gamemode named nazi zombies new experience compiles intuitive gameplay like finding best parts level kill undead find weapons damagethe campaign hours shooting mindless enemies set pieces arranging heart russia nazi trenches multiplayer class based perk system customizable weapons manage get certain amount kills row earn special killstreaks kills uav kills artillery strike kills row call dogs rip enemies apart overall call duty world war great buy like shooting hordes zombies night friends want good time killing way top leaderboards multiplayer either way going good time game

"One of the most favourite game of my childhood I have spent so much time playing it and I loved it.  From a little cute Half-Life mod to this... When Counter-Strike was first released it gained it's popularity immediately and become number 1 online action game, one of the most successful competitive games ever created which was easy to learn but hard to master, now Counter-Strike is dead or at least for someone because it's pro scene died in 2012, yes the pro scene is dead but the game itself is still alive, after so many years people still play and love this game, even it's pro scene lasted for unreal time, imagine it started in 2000 year and lasted for 12 years how cannot this be legendary, it's when graphics doesn't matter only gameplay.  I strongly recommend to play this game at least once if you have ever played it and enjoyed, it might not be as fun as before but I still recommend, if you like original games or havent played CS at all and started from CS:S, CS:GO doesn't matter... You should really give it a try.",1,one favourite game childhood spent much time playing loved little cute halflife mod counterstrike first released gained popularity immediately become number online action game one successful competitive games ever created easy learn hard master counterstrike dead least someone pro scene died yes pro scene dead game still alive many years people still play love game even pro scene lasted unreal time imagine started year lasted years cannot legendary graphics doesnt matter gameplay strongly recommend play game least ever played enjoyed might fun still recommend like original games havent played cs started css csgo doesnt matter really give try

"Many people that dislike the Call of Duty games today say that World at War is 'the last good Call of Duty game'. And honestly, I can't help but somewhat agree. Many aspects of the game make it even better than Black Ops, which is a personal favorite of mine. The campaign is awesome. Not just because of its story but because it has a co-op mode. Black Ops doesn't have a co-op mode. (Also, the story of WaW is canon to Black Ops. Just thought you should know.)  Multiplayer for World at War is better than the multiplayer in Black Ops because a dedicated server can have over 60 players. In Black Ops, dedicated servers can only have 18 people at most. Unlike the CoD games today, it also doesn't keep track of your K:D ratio.  Even Zombie Mode is just a LITTLE BIT better. There are many custom maps for Zombies and communities based on the interest of making and playing these maps. Black Ops doesn't have custom maps for Zombie Mode.  Let's hope future CoD games will be good as WaW.",1,many people dislike call duty games today say world war last good call duty game honestly cant help somewhat agree many aspects game make even better black ops personal favorite mine campaign awesome story coop mode black ops doesnt coop mode also story waw canon black ops thought know multiplayer world war better multiplayer black ops dedicated server players black ops dedicated servers people unlike cod games today also doesnt keep track kd ratio even zombie mode little bit better many custom maps zombies communities based interest making playing maps black ops doesnt custom maps zombie mode lets hope future cod games good waw

"This is an awesome little game! It is a hidden little gem i picked up for $0.21. This is a puzzle platformer that is so fun because the puzzles are very satisfying to solve. At the beginning of the game i was a confused but I quickly picked up the game mechanics due to the games perfect learning curve. In other words when the game teaches a new mechanic, it starts off easy until you are familar with the mechanic, then harder till it becomes secondhand knowledge, and THEN thats when the game shows you the next new mechanic. Of course this is not to say that you will never be stumped at some parts, after all it is what makes a puzzle game a puzzle game and takes some creative thinking BUT is never anything ridiculous to solve. The main part about this game that is kept me so hooked were all the puzzles. The harder puzzles are extreamly satisfying to solve (plenty of 'OHHH!!' moments) and secrets are very rewarding to find. The puzzles in this game will never become stale, thats because even though the puzzles are essentially the same, the variations and new mechanics keep it very fun, enjoyable, and interesting to play. One more thing is that great soundtrack, props to them!  PROS -Great learning curve -Puzzles never get boring -New Mechanics add depth -Puzzles are very satisfying to solve -Puzzles are so clever (I know i've said it a bunch but I really love the puzzles!!!) -Great price -Secrets keep the game interesting -Never too easy or too hard -Awesome music to play to  CONS -None (I can't complain as the game has everything advertised plus much more and FAR exceded my expectations)  The game is short and can not really be a con for being so, as it cost me a mere $0.21. (But the game is so awesome that I wanted more)  The reason I have more than 4 hours is because I tried to get all the 'Abandoned Cores' and 'Ancient Artifacts'  Bottomline : get this game while it's still on sale, but if it's not... still get it cause it's awesome.  P.S The very beginning with the old arcade shooter mini game is an awesome little 'backstory' and an interesting way start off the game and if you survive long enough it will explain what the 'Abandoned Cores' do and what the boss looks like (you can't defeat him!)

"The graphics may be a bit out-dated now, which may also be a good thing because almost anyone can run it, but this game is great. A lot of people complain about how terrible Call of Duty is, but this would be probably my favourite out of the the entire franchise, before Call of Duty's downfall. The campaign has a great story (WW2 is always interesting) also giving a back story to Viktor Reznov for the Black Ops players, Multiplayer is not quite polished, caught a hacker quite a few times, still I had a good time with it but more importantly, Zombies would have to be the best content on this game. All the DLCs are free, which is awesome because on Console, they are quite overpriced, also giving you all the Zombies maps for free, which is great. There is also a massive community of Custom Zombies, meaning more maps for fans, trust me there are many great ones out there.",1,graphics may bit outdated may also good thing almost anyone run game great lot people complain terrible call duty would probably favourite entire franchise call dutys downfall campaign great story ww always interesting also giving back story viktor reznov black ops players multiplayer quite polished caught hacker quite times still good time importantly zombies would best content game dlcs free awesome console quite overpriced also giving zombies maps free great also massive community custom zombies meaning maps fans trust many great ones

"Oh the classics are always the best. World at War for the PC is probably the best of all of the Call of Dutys in terms of the Zombies and realism. It has the perfect blend of an arcadey feel and gameplay with the little realistic touches, like blowing peoples legs clean off with a shotgun whilst also being able to survive a million bullets. (citation needed) The Zombies is awesome and more difficult than any of the more modern CoDs and plus it also has the custom content. Hundreds of custom maps have been created and still are being created. Some of them even have Black Ops 1/2 weapons and perks! What is not to like? 9/10 - it's still a Call of Duty game but better than the rest in my opinion.

The weaponry is positive however some outliers are outweighed by the great guns included. The multiplayer for me had some nice elements to it, mainly the maps, i personally enjoyed Makin,Castle &amp; Hangar the most as they perfectly portray the world war setting with some great barricades and spawn points, this still couldn't change my opinion about how the weakest element of this game is in fact multiplayer. Finally my favorite has to be the zombie mode primarily due to the fact that custom maps can be added,created and played. This really does give the user that discovery feel of playing endless hours, slaying hoards and hoards of zombies.  8/10",1,overall story great immersive nostalgic feel capturing elements world war era well balancing everything nice fast paced action weaponry positive however outliers outweighed great guns included multiplayer nice elements mainly maps personally enjoyed makincastle amp hangar perfectly portray world war setting great barricades spawn points still couldnt change opinion weakest element game fact multiplayer finally favorite zombie mode primarily due fact custom maps addedcreated played really give user discovery feel playing endless hours slaying hoards hoards zombies

"Although I reference multiplayer, this review focuses more on Campaign and Zombies.  Call of Duty: World at War is mostly good. The Russian campaign is very much close to the older Call of Duty games, and the introduction of Nazi Zombies was a signficant feature for Treyarch. However, World at War has key flaws that prevent it from being amongst the best of the franchise.  The game is a step in the right direction for the series however, with features added by United Offensive and the console-only Call of Duty 3 making a return, such as the ability to comandeer vehicles in multiplayer. Mod support is also a strength for this game in multiplayer, with custom zombies being a highlight of the game.  The campaign is okay. The Russian half is well done, featuring a mix of large open battles and tight sniping moments. The American campaign has more weak spots than the Russian campaign, such as the QTE's if a Banzai gets to close that can end up becoming a constant annoyance in the campaign, as well as the pacing, its just the worst of the World War 2 campaigns. The game on both ends tries to have you build emotional links with members of your squad, but the characters are not that memorable, outside of Reznov (which is probably due to him being a main character in the Treyarch games).  Engine-wise, the textures are clearly quite low-res, even on maximum settings. The added gore is a nice touch, wtih arms, legs and heads being blasted off. This also leads to new animation assets not present in the gameplay of other Call of Duty games. Ultimately, the games visuals are clearly held back by the fact that the game is still using the same engine used in Call of Duty 2.  Ultimately, World at War is still a good Call of Duty game.The variety of missions, including tank commanding and airplane gunning makes the campign still stand out, the soundtrack, especially on the final Russian missions stands out, and the modding community continues to still expand the game with custom-made content. This game also includes all the DLC from the console version included in free updates.

"The game, for the most part, is quite 'fair'. Some of the guns are kinda better than others but not so much it breaks the game (Like the Recent Cods)  You can ride tanks, play with 48 other players, and have friends to play coop  Steam is yet to be intergrated into this, and it might never will, so think of an original name.  Hackers are nowhere to be seen unlike the console versions.  Finally the campaign is good enough to play, as you arent the super mach Mason.

"In its day, CS 1.6 was the shining example of a multiplayer FPS experience. It was just one of those games that, if you didn't own it, you were just statistically worse than everyone else. Oh, how the might have fallen. Nowadays, the game is plagued with a general lack of interest, as most of its fans have moved on to its vastly superior brothers, CSS and CSGO, and for good reason.  I would recommend playersonly play on servers they trust. This is because apparently one server overwrote all of my unused keys to connect to 'xdd.ms-shadow.ro:27015', which is also a server i would recommend avoiding at all costs.  This game is a relic, a fossil from an age of gaming long past.",-1,day cs shining example multiplayer fps experience one games didnt statistically worse everyone else oh might fallen nowadays game plagued general lack interest fans moved vastly superior brothers css csgo good reason would recommend playersonly play servers trust apparently one server overwrote unused keys connect xddmsshadowro also server would recommend avoiding costs game relic fossil age gaming long past

"The last good CoD game before MW2 came along and ruined the entire franchise. Also the last CoD game to receive a proper PC port, with a plethora of graphics options as well as PC-specific control options (such as buttons for leaning left and right so you can peek around corners), and all DLC from the console version included for free (they started selling it separately with MW2).  This was, in my opinion, the last game in the series to strike the perfect ratio between realism and spectacle, with later games always including stupidly over-the-top action sequences that felt like they were ripped strait from a bad James Bond movie (the MW2 snowmobile sequence, for example). The competetive multiplayer is not as well-balanced as in CoD 2 and 4, but it's certainly not as broken as in any of the games that came after this one.  Overall, this marks the last CoD game made before the series became a total sellout. It was the last game in the franchise which remembered its roots as a PC-exclusive title (the first game in the series was originally a PC exclusive, and was  made by the same team that developed the PC-exclusive MoH Allied Assault  [www.mcvuk.com] ), and as such, the last in which the PC version was the definitive version of the game and not just a bad port of the console version. With the huge unexpected success that CoD 4 ended up being, it was only a matter of time before Activision, Infinity Ward, and Treyarch sold out and started iterating on the same formula over and over without changing much between iterations. It's just sad that we only got to have one more great game in the series before that happened.",1,last good cod game mw came along ruined entire franchise also last cod game receive proper pc port plethora graphics options well pcspecific control options buttons leaning left right peek around corners dlc console version included free started selling separately mw opinion last game series strike perfect ratio realism spectacle later games always including stupidly overthetop action sequences felt like ripped strait bad james bond movie mw snowmobile sequence example competetive multiplayer wellbalanced cod certainly broken games came one overall marks last cod game made series became total sellout last game franchise remembered roots pcexclusive title first game series originally pc exclusive made team developed pcexclusive moh allied assault wwwmcvukcom last pc version definitive version game bad port console version huge unexpected success cod ended matter time activision infinity ward treyarch sold started iterating formula without changing much iterations sad got one great game series happened

"This game is great. It takes place in WWII and that's awesome, the campaign is awesome, this game is just, awesome.     The campaign, or solo is really fun. It's really great, has a good storyline (cause most of it actually happened). And the game made the storyline something that, has a story. It's like they took every aspect of WWII and made it into a game. The action, the sorrow, the war, the real events and how they were put into a game. Did I mention that you can have up to 4 people in campaign? Not bots, your friends. Enough about what actually happend, now for the zombie mode.    Nazi zombies... it sounds so stupid, but it actually makes sense. Plus it's the most fun thing in the world. People buy this game JUST FOR NAZI ZOMBIES. And it may be the best zombie mode in any Call of Duty game. It's fun with friends and it's fun in solo mode. Exept for when you die. Because there is no one who will save you when you fall in solo. In multiplayer it's not so bad if you die. You just go down, and other players can revive you. Once you die though it's annoying. Especially if your friends are in the later rounds. You have to wait about 10 mins for the round to end and when you respawn, you lose your weapons. So, Rule 1: Don't go down.   Team deathmatch is really bad and requires lots of mods and will probably give you a virus. So if you do, make sure it's with people you trust.   This game is great, and I'll try to keep this review short...ish. Also, tanks. So buy this game. It was my first Call of Duty game. If you're new to the franchise, this would be the perfect starting game. It's great for people who have played Call of Duty games before too. So, this game is good. Really, really good.",1,game great takes place wwii thats awesome campaign awesome game awesome campaign solo really fun really great good storyline cause actually happened game made storyline something story like took every aspect wwii made game action sorrow war real events put game mention people campaign bots friends enough actually happend zombie mode nazi zombies sounds stupid actually makes sense plus fun thing world people buy game nazi zombies may best zombie mode call duty game fun friends fun solo mode exept die one save fall solo multiplayer bad die go players revive die though annoying especially friends later rounds wait mins round end respawn lose weapons rule dont go team deathmatch really bad requires lots mods probably give virus make sure people trust game great ill try keep review shortish also tanks buy game first call duty game youre new franchise would perfect starting game great people played call duty games game good really really good

A wave of nostalgia hit me when I played Mutliplayer. Playing maps from Castle, to Asylum, to even Cliffside, it made me tear up because of how great this game is.  Don't even get me started on Nazi Zombies. Nazi Zombies is the CLASSIC zombies that we all love to this day. I always hear people call World at War zombies ♥♥♥♥ compared to the remake in Black Ops but the truth it, it's better. I feel as if there's more of a challenge in the original Nazi Zombie maps than in any other zombie maps for Black Ops 1/2.  If you want my recommendation, I'd say yes. Even after 7 years, almost 8, I can promise you'll have a great time.",1,world war next black ops best call duty ever made recently bought game pc playing years console stopping broke wave nostalgia hit played mutliplayer playing maps castle asylum even cliffside made tear great game dont even get started nazi zombies nazi zombies classic zombies love day always hear people call world war zombies compared remake black ops truth better feel theres challenge original nazi zombie maps zombie maps black ops want recommendation id say yes even years almost promise youll great time

I think, that it is a great game, but perhaps some players will be put off by the old graphics, but these are pretty good, if you imagine, that this game is about 16 years old.

"Welcome to my review for call of duty world at war.  Overview: call of duty world at war is a great call of duty game and extremly fun. While everyone says its a copy and paste of cod 4 its a good one and i'm glad treyarch made a ww2 version of cod 4 because the ww2 cods were great. If your wondering where all the dlc is its included in the game and its a good price for the base game and all 4 map packs.  Campaign: The campaign is really cool and it proves the struggle that the russians had during the germans rise to power. Its one of those games that are so gorey that it makes you grateful that you didnt have to go to war and it makes you apreciate the army's work, for example you shoot someone in the arm and it will fly off and blood will splatter everywhere, shoot someone in the head with a shotgun and the enemys head will fly off, shoot someone in the leg and both legs will fly off. The story is great, you play as 2 different characters in the campaign: Dimitri petrenko (russian) &amp; private C miller, On the American side you play as private C miller and you escape torture and raid the japanese camp that you escape from and continue to fight the war. It leads you through a long war that will keep you going for ages. For example on mission 2 theres an easter egg that lets you have a ray gun and mission 3 you get a flamethrower and another badass american mission is when you play as a commander on a ww2 plane and you feel like your raining death (a bit like death from above from cod 4, as i said this is a ww2 version of cod 4). The russian side where you play as dimitri is probably the best part of the campaign because it has the more badass missions. You start off by being in the middle of a massacre at a town square only to meet sergeant reznov who helps you avange the massacre. You continue the campaign trying to regain control of the reichstag (end 2 missions of the campaign) but through that journey you murder as many germans as you can, you even go to their homeland and murder them there. Theres also a russian mission where you drive a tank as means of transport. The ending of the Russian campaign (end of campaign acctually) is badass and im not going to spoil it, just youtube it or play the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.  Overall i think the campaign is great and worth the price inculded in the game, i rate is 8/10  Multiplayer: I dont really play much of this, probably a quarter of my hours but i stopped playing because of how many hackers are in multiplayer. Just like cod 4 you have 5 create-a-class slots with a primary weapon and 1 attachment, a secondary weapon, an equipment slot, 3 perk slots and a vehicle slot (yes some maps you can drive a tank). There is a great gamemode called war where theres a flag you have to capture and the more kills you get the faster you can capture a flag, im not going into to much detail because thats pretty much all war is. The maps are surprisingly really fun and i really enjoy them.  Overall i give the multiplayer 7/10 because of the hackers, if there wasnt hackers i would give 8/10  Zombies: This is probably my most played part and it is because of custom zombies. Custom zombies is really fun and the people out there create some amazing maps maybe even better than treyarchs default map. I wouldn't suggest playing co-op zombies unless your playing with a friend because people will steal your window and you get people on the mic but if you play solo or with a friend you save yourself from the migraines. The 4 default zombies maps are included (nacht der toten, verruckt, shi no numa &amp; der reise) and they has some really nice features (shame that only der reise has pack a punch). There are 4 perks in zombies to which is very obvious (quick revive, speedcola, juggernog and double tap). Quick revive is a self revive on solo which means when you down you can get back up but you only have 3 uses, juggernog increases your health from 2 hits to die to 4-5 hits to die, speedcola makes you reload double fast and double tap lets you shoot 2x as fast. The guns are good but not amazing unless you have the ray gun or unless your on der reise and can pack a punch (pack a punch gives you a cool camo and shooting sound and doubles, qtriples or quadruples your gun damage, not sure which).  Overall i think zombies is the best part, I wouldn't mind paying £20 for the zombies on its own but I rate the zombies part 9.5/10.  One last note: If anyone does buy the game or enjoyed the review please thumbs up as this is the first review I have spent very long on but if you do get the game please send me a friend request, I'm always looking for friends on zombies but anyways buy the game and I promise you will love it.

"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.",1,experience game type review saying things like great gameplay suit something ive experienced counterstrike go remember back friends house playing game didnt know name game internet find weeks passed another friend came didnt computer brought disc game told one best games moment knew going game saw friends house saw counterstrike logo filled gamegasm happy dont remember day happy like back journey started playing hardcore made friends clans involved communities even made two counterstrike first game played competitively whole experience playing public servers maybe servers mods fun playing competitively made intense stressful pleasant way ofcourse shooters days try different advanced way sometimes simple games like counterstrike ones live day also plenty mods keep attention game gameplay simple defend counterterrorist attack terrorist plant bomb save hostages ct sure already know doubt gamers havent heard know gameplay counterstrike sharing experience wish could find cs anthology account ive lost since decided going buy game go thousand hours played still play time time day brings back many great memories sometimes even stumble upon people ive played years ago think counterstrike changed gaming major way wouldnt many games like today game wouldnt exist sure many people already played games like csgo never roots doubt play hour much simple differs lot opinion csgo modern games

"World War II (WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War (after the recent Great War), was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, though related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nations—including all of the great powers—eventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of 'total war', the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (during which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (during which approximately one million people were killed, including the use of two nuclear weapons in combat), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.   The Empire of Japan aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific and was already at war with the Republic of China in 1937, but the world war is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939[6] with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan. Following the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours, including Poland, Finland and the Baltic states. The United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth were the only Allied forces continuing the fight against the Axis, with campaigns in North Africa and the Horn of Africa as well as the long-running Battle of the Atlantic. In June 1941, the European Axis powers launched an invasion of the Soviet Union, opening the largest land theatre of war in history, which trapped the major part of the Axis' military forces into a war of attrition. In December 1941, Japan attacked the United States and European territories in the Pacific Ocean, and quickly conquered much of the Western Pacific.  The Axis advance halted in 1942 when Japan lost the critical Battle of Midway, near Hawaii, and Germany was defeated in North Africa and then, decisively, at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union. In 1943, with a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front, the Allied invasion of Italy which brought about Italian surrender, and Allied victories in the Pacific, the Axis lost the initiative and undertook strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies invaded France, while the Soviet Union regained all of its territorial losses and invaded Germany and its allies. During 1944 and 1945 the Japanese suffered major reverses in mainland Asia in South Central China and Burma, while the Allies crippled the Japanese Navy and captured key Western Pacific islands.  The war in Europe ended with an invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union culminating in the capture of Berlin by Soviet and Polish troops and the subsequent German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945. Following the Potsdam Declaration by the Allies on 26 July 1945, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 August and 9 August respectively. With an invasion of the Japanese archipelago imminent, the possibility of additional atomic bombings, and the Soviet Union's declaration of war on Japan and invasion of Manchuria, Japan surrendered on 15 August 1945. Thus ended the war in Asia, and the final destruction of the Axis bloc.  World War II altered the political alignment and social structure of the world. The United Nations (UN) was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts. The victorious great powers—the United States, the Soviet Union, China, the United Kingdom, and France—became the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the Cold War, which lasted for the next 46 years. Meanwhile, the influence of European great powers waned, while the decolonisation of Asia and Africa began. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery. Political integration, especially in Europe, emerged as an effort to end pre-war enmities and to create a common identity.",1,world war ii wwii ww also known second world war recent great war global war lasted though related conflicts began earlier involved vast majority worlds nationsincluding great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances allies axis widespread war history directly involved million people countries state total war major participants threw entire economic industrial scientific capabilities behind war effort erasing distinction civilian military resources marked mass deaths civilians including holocaust approximately million people killed strategic bombing industrial population centres approximately one million people killed including use two nuclear weapons combat resulted estimated million million fatalities made world war ii deadliest conflict human history empire japan aimed dominate asia pacific already war republic china world war generally said begun september invasion poland germany subsequent declarations war germany france united kingdom late early series campaigns treaties germany conquered controlled much continental europe formed axis alliance italy japan following molotovribbentrop pact germany soviet union partitioned annexed territories european neighbours including poland finland baltic states united kingdom british commonwealth allied forces continuing fight axis campaigns north africa horn africa well longrunning battle atlantic june european axis powers launched invasion soviet union opening largest land theatre war history trapped major part axis military forces war attrition december japan attacked united states european territories pacific ocean quickly conquered much western pacific axis advance halted japan lost critical battle midway near hawaii germany defeated north africa decisively stalingrad soviet union series german defeats eastern front allied invasion italy brought italian surrender allied victories pacific axis lost initiative undertook strategic retreat fronts western allies invaded france soviet union regained territorial losses invaded germany allies japanese suffered major reverses mainland asia south central china burma allies crippled japanese navy captured key western pacific islands war europe ended invasion germany western allies soviet union culminating capture berlin soviet polish troops subsequent german unconditional surrender may following potsdam declaration allies july united states dropped atomic bombs japanese cities hiroshima nagasaki august august respectively invasion japanese archipelago imminent possibility additional atomic bombings soviet unions declaration war japan invasion manchuria japan surrendered august thus ended war asia final destruction axis bloc world war ii altered political alignment social structure world united nations un established foster international cooperation prevent future conflicts victorious great powersthe united states soviet union china united kingdom francebecame permanent members united nations security council soviet union united states emerged rival superpowers setting stage cold war lasted next years meanwhile influence european great powers waned decolonisation asia africa began countries whose industries damaged moved towards economic recovery political integration especially europe emerged effort end prewar enmities create common identity

"Recently bought this game on steam (put in alot of hours before on non-steam edition) Its a great game, my favorite part is the 4 player co-op option for the campaign, I don't understand why more games don't have this kind of feature. Along with that the storyline is heck of all fun, its not take one level and then copy-paste it and call it a campaign, the missions are actually unique through the entire game! The multiplayer is fine, its frustrating when people start camping in buildings, but its pretty rewarding to kill them and claim your revenge! By now most likely you're probably getting this game for Zombies, still somewhat active, but I wouldn't recommend playing on pub matches, playing with friends is really the only way to play this game, which is an awesome way to play.  7/10 (Zombies doesn't have a whole lot of maps, not a great many zombies matches, even then you do get kicked out of some of them, and multiplayer is frustrating at times, thats why its not 10/10)",1,recently bought game steam put alot hours nonsteam edition great game favorite part player coop option campaign dont understand games dont kind feature along storyline heck fun take one level copypaste call campaign missions actually unique entire game multiplayer fine frustrating people start camping buildings pretty rewarding kill claim revenge likely youre probably getting game zombies still somewhat active wouldnt recommend playing pub matches playing friends really way play game awesome way play zombies doesnt whole lot maps great many zombies matches even get kicked multiplayer frustrating times thats

While CS: GO is my personal favorite, CS 1.6 is still damn fun, and given that it's an older game, you can play it on literally anything nowadays. There's a single-player mode with bots, perfect for newbies or lone wolves, but make sure you've practiced before hopping online, or you'll get destroyed. tl;dr you can't go wrong with this game.",1,still ages well many ways addition probably goldsrc game still players good reason css game mechanics tried true still hold despite two sequels almost two decades cs go personal favorite cs still damn fun given older game play literally anything nowadays theres singleplayer mode bots perfect newbies lone wolves make sure youve practiced hopping online youll get destroyed tldr cant go wrong game

I bought the game to play Co-Op with my son over LAN. It does not work over LAN. I just spent 3 hours ready many reports by people saying the exact same thing on every forum I went to. It seems to be a problem with the IP or something. I give up. Why should I pay for a game and spend more time roleplaying tech support than actually doing what I payed for? I shouldn't and neither should you. Don't buy it if you even remotely enjoy playing games over LAN. It's painful.,-1,bought game play coop son lan work lan spent hours ready many reports people saying exact thing every forum went seems problem ip something give pay game spend time roleplaying tech support actually payed shouldnt neither dont buy even remotely enjoy playing games lan painful

"First off, I'm going to start by saying this review is based solely on the single player campaign.  Mechanics wise, it's a standard CoD shooter. You stay in cover and shoot, run away from/throw back grenades that come your way, and with the odd mission where you get to do something special. So nothing to write home about.  The campaign is split in two sides; Private Miller (Americans fighting against Japan) and Private Petrenko (Russians fighting against Nazi Germans). On the whole the campaign is very fun however there can be a few annoying moments, such as the 'Snipe Off'. It playes out several missions on one side and then several on the other, until it reaches a conclusion. I found the 'NPCs' on the Russians to much more interesting than the Americans but was annoyed to find the Player Characters lacking a voice and personality aside from grunts and intense breathing.  There are two 'special' missions in the campaign, one for each side. The Russian one consisits of you driving a T-34 tank around and blowing up various Nazi structures, infantry and vehicles. The American one is far more interesting and puts you in the boots of Petty Officer Locke, a gunner aboard a PBY Catalina where you have to destroy Japanese supply ships and then loop back to help a US fleet that's under attack by a Japanese air/water assault.   All in all a solid game with a few memorable characters; 7/10",1,first im going start saying review based solely single player campaign mechanics wise standard cod shooter stay cover shoot run away fromthrow back grenades come way odd mission get something special nothing write home campaign split two sides private miller americans fighting japan private petrenko russians fighting nazi germans whole campaign fun however annoying moments snipe playes several missions one side several reaches conclusion found npcs russians much interesting americans annoyed find player characters lacking voice personality aside grunts intense breathing two special missions campaign one side russian one consisits driving tank around blowing various nazi structures infantry vehicles american one far interesting puts boots petty officer locke gunner aboard pby catalina destroy japanese supply ships loop back help us fleet thats attack japanese airwater assault solid game memorable characters

The custom maps feature unique guns, easter eggs, perks, etc. and will provide an immeasurable amount of life into the game. All the custom maps I've come across have thier own auto-installer. After installing custom zombie maps, you can launch them straight-away from the main menu under 'Mods'. So if you're buying this for Custom Zombies, you won't be dissapointed.

"Terrific modeling app for anyone who's comfortable Maya's polygon modeling tool. It has all the expected featres you need for modeling plus some nice options for mapping/manipulating UV and texture paint. It has a uncluttered, clean but flexible UI where you can have dialogs pop up in docks or floating, which you can then drag to the dock to stay. You can save all your preferences to a backup, which is quite valuable but underrated feature. Autosave works nicely (which is good, cause Silo2 crashes on me sometimes doing boolean operations). It has a good wealth of import/export geometry formats and seems to have no problem importing texture mappings with 3DS/FBX and others.   Hope to see stability improved though with boolean subtract.",1,terrific modeling app anyone whos comfortable mayas polygon modeling tool expected featres need modeling plus nice options mappingmanipulating uv texture paint uncluttered clean flexible ui dialogs pop docks floating drag dock stay save preferences backup quite valuable underrated feature autosave works nicely good cause silo crashes sometimes boolean operations good wealth importexport geometry formats seems problem importing texture mappings dsfbx others hope see stability improved though boolean subtract

The multiplayer is exactly what you expect but with an arsenal of WW2 weapons, better map design, pretty much no servers using killstreaks and a lot of hackers/modded servers. Zombies is also pretty good. It's not extremley complicated like Black ops 2 or 3 so it's easy to hop into but one of the best things about this game is Custom Zombies. The community creates many great maps like Leviathan, Dead Ship and Mario 64. Custom Zombies is pretty much the biggest highlight of the game so I recommend this if you are willing to pay the stupid price. If not, then just get it on a sale.",1,good call duty game bit overpriced activision campaign fine great moments like whole mission vendetta multiplayer exactly expect arsenal ww weapons better map design pretty much servers using killstreaks lot hackersmodded servers zombies also pretty good extremley complicated like black ops easy hop one best things game custom zombies community creates many great maps like leviathan dead ship mario custom zombies pretty much biggest highlight game recommend willing pay stupid price get sale

"Positives: I was able to download tons of zombie maps for free, and I can play with my friends online, or just join a random online lobby, which there are tons of.   Negatives: If you are playing solo, you are not able to use your wifi connection reliably. What I mean by that is, your game will get really laggy if you are playing on solo mode because you're not online, so you can't use the internet that you have while you're playing, even if you have a fast connection.  Overall: A great gaming experience for everybody. It is great for just sitting back, relaxing, and playing and having a good time with your friends.

"I would most definitely reccomend this game to any FPS lover. It mixes a great combo of fiction and realism, while maintaining the best (in my opinion) story line in all of the COD series. I have logged near 600 Hours into this game, and have enjoyed all of them. Besides custom zombies, the ability to mod and play all the minigames is unreal. Custom zombies makes this game worth $20 the instant you play it. Zombie maps get boring once you play them as much as i have, so it's really nice to mix it up a little bit. There are literally Thousands of map options, from modern to classic, and big to small, they literally have it all. The next time you are tempted to buy a game, this should definitely be the one. In my opinion, this is one of the best games i have ever played.",1,would definitely reccomend game fps lover mixes great combo fiction realism maintaining best opinion story line cod series logged near hours game enjoyed besides custom zombies ability mod play minigames unreal custom zombies makes game worth instant play zombie maps get boring play much really nice mix little bit literally thousands map options modern classic big small literally next time tempted buy game definitely one opinion one best games ever played

"Because I'm such a huge fan of CS:GO and CS:S, I decided to purchase and play the original Counter Strike. However good the game may be it's all based on petty nostalgia. If you were to compare the game to CS:S or CS:GO you would realize how inferior it really is to the two. You might say that CS:GO turned crap once Valve added cases and payed cosmetics, and in turn that makes CS 1.6 better than CS:GO. To that I say CS:GO has better graphics (no surprise) and better controls, if it's the payed skins that turn you away from the game then just don't buy skins/cases/keys.

"Counter-Strike is a multiplayer spin-off game to the Half Life franchise. Set in the same universe except focused on the HECU Marines themselves. There is no plot to this game, it's purpose is to establish a fun co-op multiplayer game that allows gamers to either fight it off or team up around the globe. There is a selection of different locations for the areas and different types of game play to create endless possible features wether you play as the marines or the terrorists is all up to you. This game was so successful it established a large fan base and spawn a few sequals. If you want to play a classic online multiplayer, you can't go more classic than this.

"Silo 2 is a great program if you have more than a beginner level of understanding when it comes to modeling. I've only used it for a few things but from what I can see the program has a lot of good tools and simple UV unwrapping. When it comes down to it and you are looking for a cheap lightweight modeling program, this is something you may want to consider. I would say that Silo is more for advanced users, the documentation is kind of lacking and there haven't been any updates to it for quite some time. The sculpting part of it is a little weird, I would not recommend this if you're wanting to sculpt something. I would look into tools that contain dedicated systems for this such as ZBrush, Mudbox, or the most common free tool, Blender.

"Coming from a CoD fanboy ever since Black Ops 1, this game is amazing, but in its own way... You can definatly see that this game is almost 10 years old now yet still has so much to do in this old game. Pros first. The graphics definatly aint a problem for me atleast. It looks fantastic for a 8 year old game! The campaign is so gory and immersive. In the second mission you go to Normandy beaches to fight in D-Day, and it honastly gave me chills seeing all the explosions and gunshots with the sound of everyone yelling. Another pro is Modding. Zombies is definatly one of the best gamemodes for the Call Of Duty series. And now we can make our own zombies experience which Treyarch said at comic con 2015 a fan asked 'Will zombie modding be back in Black ops 3?' and David Vonderhaar said 'We're thinking about it. And the whole press confrance started cheering and stood up to clap. Modding is not a bad thing. It gives games life spans. Like Fallout 3 without mods it would'nt have lasted. Cons are very small and expected in a old game. Drops in frame rate. Bugs in zombies mode where you loose your Juggernog if you shock yourself with a WunderwaffleDG2. If you love COD and a big zombies fan. Pick this game up now I highly recomened it!",1,coming cod fanboy ever since black ops game amazing way definatly see game almost years old yet still much old game pros first graphics definatly aint problem atleast looks fantastic year old game campaign gory immersive second mission go normandy beaches fight dday honastly gave chills seeing explosions gunshots sound everyone yelling another pro modding zombies definatly one best gamemodes call duty series make zombies experience treyarch said comic con fan asked zombie modding back black ops david vonderhaar said thinking whole press confrance started cheering stood clap modding bad thing gives games life spans like fallout without mods wouldnt lasted cons small expected old game drops frame rate bugs zombies mode loose juggernog shock wunderwaffledg love cod big zombies fan pick game highly recomened

"Before I go into detail about anything, I'll just quickly say I give this a 8/10; 'Better than expected'. 1) STORY/CHARACTERS This game is set during the second world war. Across the single player campaign, you play as a total of three characters. For the most part, you play as a US Marine, fighting against the Japanese on islands across the Pacific, including parts of Japan, and a Russian infantryman fighting in places like Stalingrad and Berlin. For one mission, you play as a gunner on a US aircraft, shooting down other planes and destroying boats. You may notice that I didn't name any of the characters. That's because I don't remember their names. Well, I know that the Russian soldier was named Dimitri, but I'm pretty sure every Russian character in Call of Duty is named Dimitri. The other two had names, but like I said, none of the characters were very memorable. Most of them, I remembered as 'The guy with the trenchcoat' or 'The guy with the banner'. The actual plot is very predictable -- and essentially not there. The story doesn't develop any personality for the characters, and it simply retells events that have already happened, so many people will already know what happens. 2) REALISM The game includes, between missions, actual film of battles in World War 2, and when comparing the film to the game, I can tell that the characters' uniforms and equipment are, as far as appearance goes, represented quite well. There are probably some discrepancies, but it looks as good as it needs to. I didn't bother checking to see how accurate the tactics used by NPCs were, but the tactics used seem plausible. For example, flanking enemy MG positions through their own trenches. Also, I've read that Japanese tactics were very inflexible. For example, once they decided on a plan they would go with that plan even if their enemies made it completely impossible. US soldiers in the game describe the Japanese enemies as 'stubborn', and they tend to be unwavering for the most part, so I think they did reasonably well on that part. Now, as far as the actual gunplay goes, this game's idea of ballistics is entirely made up. Bullets are not affected by gravity or wind, and are always either too powerful or not powerful enough. One minute your enemy ignores a shot to the gut, the next minute his arm flies off from one shot. 3) REPLAYABILITY Barely any. Like I said, it's good for when you just need something to take your mind off of how sick you are while you're laying in bed, coughing your guts out. I will probably play it next time I have a cold or the flu, but not much else. 4) ENTERTAINMENT VALUE Generally, I go with a 'dollars per hour' system, where I take the price ($20) and the amount of time I spend playing it (6 hours) and, if it's a 1:1 match, it was worth the money. I actually got this on sale for about $10, but it's still not quite worth it yet. Chances are I will play it again sometime, but it's probably not worth it for the full $20. Also, keep in mind that I was able to beat the campaign in one sitting. However, multiplayer is quite enjoyable, which makes up for the lacking single player. 5) MULTIPLAYER 'Tactical Crouch Servers' are the best. Just go join one and you'll see. The best part: People actually behave like civilized human beings, unlike the newer CoD games. FINAL VERDICT: 8/10; better than I expected",1,go detail anything ill quickly say give better expected storycharacters game set second world war across single player campaign play total three characters part play us marine fighting japanese islands across pacific including parts japan russian infantryman fighting places like stalingrad berlin one mission play gunner us aircraft shooting planes destroying boats may notice didnt name characters thats dont remember names well know russian soldier named dimitri im pretty sure every russian character call duty named dimitri two names like said none characters memorable remembered guy trenchcoat guy banner actual plot predictable essentially story doesnt develop personality characters simply retells events already happened many people already know happens realism game includes missions actual film battles world war comparing film game tell characters uniforms equipment far appearance goes represented quite well probably discrepancies looks good needs didnt bother checking see accurate tactics used npcs tactics used seem plausible example flanking enemy mg positions trenches also ive read japanese tactics inflexible example decided plan would go plan even enemies made completely impossible us soldiers game describe japanese enemies stubborn tend unwavering part think reasonably well part far actual gunplay goes games idea ballistics entirely made bullets affected gravity wind always either powerful powerful enough one minute enemy ignores shot gut next minute arm flies one shot replayability barely like said good need something take mind sick youre laying bed coughing guts probably play next time cold flu much else entertainment value generally go dollars per hour system take price amount time spend playing hours match worth money actually got sale still quite worth yet chances play sometime probably worth full also keep mind able beat campaign one sitting however multiplayer quite enjoyable makes lacking single player multiplayer tactical crouch servers best go join one youll see best part people actually behave like civilized human beings unlike newer cod games final verdict better expected

I would rate W.a.W Campain a 7.5/10 For the zombies part of C.O.D, now this part is very fun, I mean you can mod and download custom maps from the internet!! Its so fun, the one thing I dont like about W.a.W is the knifing... Yes the good old knifing. You see, when you knife you sort of dig into the zombie where Black Ops 1-3 its very nice to knife zombies, it doesn't dig into the zombie. Other than those couple of flaws Zombies is very fun on W.a.W. I would rate W.a.W Zombies a 8/10 Now, last but not least Multiplayer, yes Multiplayer on W.a.W is sort of odd, up until a couple weeks ago I didnt even know there was a multiplayer option until my friend told me. But its still okay, its not my favourite multiplayer game but its fine. I would rate W.a.W Multiplayer a 5.5/10.

"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the current iteration of Valve’s top-in-class competitive shooter, and the first to be maintained in the very modern way it has been. Learning from its experience with Team Fortress 2, Valve has a miniature economy in CS: GO that revolves entirely around gun decals. Players get a few ‘drops’ a week after matches, which can be a gun decal or a weapon crate – the latter of which cost £1.49 to unlock with a one-use key from the store. Obviously this economy is tailor-made, and so there are extraordinarily rare and mysteriously fantastic-looking gun and knife skins (with prices in the hundreds of pounds), then a large range of other skins tapering down to the common-as-muck variety that trades for pennies.  I don’t pay much attention to the CS: GO economy as a whole, though it’s interesting enough, but it’s important for a non-player to understand that a big chunk of the game’s audience takes it very seriously indeed. In the days after a new Operation launches countless forum threads are launched about the value of the new goods, whether someone should sell this new rare drop they got or hold it for a while, Twitch streams with giveaways and 50 crates being unlocked and so on. You get the picture.    I give such context on CS: GO’s economy because – even though it is a subsidiary part of the game to many including myself – it is the molten core of Operation Vanguard. CS: GO is a regularly-patched game but the major updates come in the form of Operations that introduce new maps and new skins, at the price of around £3 for an access pass – with the nice touch that maps are available to all players regardless, or made so shortly afterwards.  To give an exhaustive history of Operations would be no more useful than a general overview. If you play Counter-Strike then the chances are you play a lot of Counter-Strike. What the Operations do is freshen things up a bit – naturally they don’t disrupt the regular Dust-Mirage-Inferno cycle of competitive play, but you get some unfamiliar environments to tool about in, the chance to score some fancy new weapons, and in the context of a game you play almost daily, £3 a few times a year is chicken feed.  Operation Vanguard is different, and the changes are not for the better. The first problem I have with it is major: the way it’s sold seems to skirt the borderline of deception. To participate in Operation Breakout you bought an ‘All-Access Pass’ for £2.39. To participate in Operation Vanguard I bought an ‘Access Pass’ for £2.39. The difference is obvious side-by-side, but of course when OV popped up in Counter-Strike’s home menu I bought it more or less instantly, thinking this was the same thing.  OV’s selling point is two ‘campaigns,’ a series of missions with three branching paths. The missions are things like ‘Win 16 rounds on map X’ and ‘Kill 20 chickens in Deathmatch mode,’ and completing one bags a pre-determined award – either a weapon crate or a random weapon from a specified collection. So far, so OK. But in fact OV has two more campaigns, both of which cost £1.79 to access – which follow more or less the same pattern.    To be crystal-clear about this, the money is not the problem. I’m happy to pay for Operations, and OV’s combined total of around £6 in the context of the time I put into Counter-Strike is really not an issue. But that switch from ‘All-Access Pass’ to ‘Access Pass (with the right to buy more access)’, just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me right off.  First of all I felt conned. I bought the OV pass in the same way I’d bought all the previous Operation passes, expected it to be the same deal, and realised I’d been fooled by the removal of ‘All.’ Secondly, what the two ‘extra’ purchases offer is basically a re-skinned version of OV’s mission book. But thirdly, and this is the real killer, you’re encouraged to buy them to self-medicate the most egregious, enormous, climactically wrong and frankly offensive design decision in Vanguard.  There are multi-day cooldowns on missions. That’s right Rambo, you may have thought you were buying another set of missions and drops to liven up day-to-day business in CS: GO, but in fact Vanguard is a campaign designed to play out over a set period of time, with the only limiting factor a bald external one: cooldown timers.  Let me set the scene for you. I love Counter-Strike. I saw Vanguard was out on a Thursday, and cleared Friday night. Got in a few beers. Booted it up and bought the pass. I played the first mission, cleared it in about 15 minutes. Chose a second, the killing chickens one, and that was another 15 mins. So around half an hour into my evening of joy I was given a four-day cooldown for the next mission.    You can slice this any way you want, but it’s ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The sad thing is I get the thought process behind it. Consider: you’re Valve, in charge of a game where players (a) want new content but (b) put in so many hours that they’ll rush through anything almost instantly. For example, mission chains. Operation Breakout introduced missions in the form of random drops, which parcelled them out over time but had no larger arc. It was fine but the missions never felt… important. So Operation Vanguard’s missions are in structured patterns, with defined rewards, and are given the desired longevity through simple brute force of timing. You will not complete this content before we say so, because you can’t.  Oh, except that if you buy the extra mission packs, your cooldowns decrease across the board, because now you’re allowed to do more missions in a set period. That’s right. You’re basically paying to reduce cooldowns. In a Valve game.  The thing is that Operation Vanguard is only a ‘campaign’ in the same way that a pile of biscuits is ‘lunch.’ The missions are basic objectives like ‘Win 16 competitive rounds on Season’ or ‘Get 100 FAMAS kills in Deathmatch mode.’ And what do you get for completing them? Either a drop from an existing collection of guns, with a minor chance of a rare gun, or a weapon crate. The first is fair enough, but the second… I mean, at this point I already felt pretty rinsed by Operation Vanguard, and now it’s ‘rewarding’ me with crates that I need to pay more money to open.    There is a school of thought that says Valve has done this in order that a flood of new crates and mission rewards doesn’t flood the in-game economy, instead trickling them in over the coming months. To that argument the only appropriate response is – who cares? I play Counter-Strike: GO because it’s a great game, I don’t play it because of the economy, and while I accept the latter is how Valve makes money, the moment it starts intruding into the game – if indeed this explanation holds water – then the economy is not acting in the way that it should. That is, it should be improving the experience rather than throttling it.  The sad thing is that Operation Vanguard comes with my favourite selection of community maps yet, including two in Season and Back Alley that feel like potential classics. Yeah they’re all over the place in terms of favouring one side or the other, but this is par for the course with CS: GO and will be tweaked over the coming months. Every CS: GO operation freshens the game up with some new environments if nothing else, and the point of Operation Vanguard’s structure is to elongate this beyond a few days – to really showcase these excellent maps by forcing people to play on them semi-regularly for missions. It at least manages this.  I want to emphasise that I’m an enormous fan and c",-1,counterstrike global offensive current iteration valves topinclass competitive shooter first maintained modern way learning experience team fortress valve miniature economy cs go revolves entirely around gun decals players get drops week matches gun decal weapon crate latter cost unlock oneuse key store obviously economy tailormade extraordinarily rare mysteriously fantasticlooking gun knife skins prices hundreds pounds large range skins tapering commonasmuck variety trades pennies dont pay much attention cs go economy whole though interesting enough important nonplayer understand big chunk games audience takes seriously indeed days new operation launches countless forum threads launched value new goods whether someone sell new rare drop got hold twitch streams giveaways crates unlocked get picture give context cs gos economy even though subsidiary part game many including molten core operation vanguard cs go regularlypatched game major updates come form operations introduce new maps new skins price around access pass nice touch maps available players regardless made shortly afterwards give exhaustive history operations would useful general overview play counterstrike chances play lot counterstrike operations freshen things bit naturally dont disrupt regular dustmirageinferno cycle competitive play get unfamiliar environments tool chance score fancy new weapons context game play almost daily times year chicken feed operation vanguard different changes better first problem major way sold seems skirt borderline deception participate operation breakout bought allaccess pass participate operation vanguard bought access pass difference obvious sidebyside course ov popped counterstrikes home menu bought less instantly thinking thing ovs selling point two campaigns series missions three branching paths missions things like win rounds map x kill chickens deathmatch mode completing one bags predetermined award either weapon crate random weapon specified collection far ok fact ov two campaigns cost access follow less pattern crystalclear money problem im happy pay operations ovs combined total around context time put counterstrike really issue switch allaccess pass access pass right buy access right first felt conned bought ov pass way id bought previous operation passes expected deal realised id fooled removal secondly two extra purchases offer basically reskinned version ovs mission book thirdly real killer youre encouraged buy selfmedicate egregious enormous climactically wrong frankly offensive design decision vanguard multiday cooldowns missions thats right rambo may thought buying another set missions drops liven daytoday business cs go fact vanguard campaign designed play set period time limiting factor bald external one cooldown timers let set scene love counterstrike saw vanguard thursday cleared friday night got beers booted bought pass played first mission cleared minutes chose second killing chickens one another mins around half hour evening joy given fourday cooldown next mission slice way want sad thing get thought process behind consider youre valve charge game players want new content b put many hours theyll rush anything almost instantly example mission chains operation breakout introduced missions form random drops parcelled time larger arc fine missions never felt important operation vanguards missions structured patterns defined rewards given desired longevity simple brute force timing complete content say cant oh except buy extra mission packs cooldowns decrease across board youre allowed missions set period thats right youre basically paying reduce cooldowns valve game thing operation vanguard campaign way pile biscuits lunch missions basic objectives like win competitive rounds season get famas kills deathmatch mode get completing either drop existing collection guns minor chance rare gun weapon crate first fair enough second mean point already felt pretty rinsed operation vanguard rewarding crates need pay money open school thought says valve done order flood new crates mission rewards doesnt flood ingame economy instead trickling coming months argument appropriate response cares play counterstrike go great game dont play economy accept latter valve makes money moment starts intruding game indeed explanation holds water economy acting way improving experience rather throttling sad thing operation vanguard comes favourite selection community maps yet including two season back alley feel like potential classics yeah theyre place terms favouring one side par course cs go tweaked coming months every cs go operation freshens game new environments nothing else point operation vanguards structure elongate beyond days really showcase excellent maps forcing people play semiregularly missions least manages want emphasise im enormous fan c

"I first played this game when it first came out on my trusty xbox 360 and was optimistic how the elements of the game would play out in a world war two format, it was an enjoyable game all round. It had an immersive campaign which was challenging yet very entertaining with unanticipated plot twists, the multiplayer had a very nice flowing feel to it with a large selection of unlockable items/weapons which gave you a sense of progression as you played which made you want to keep playing to level up your character. Now the zombie game mode was the main reason i invested in this game again as i had heard interesting things about it due to the ability to download custom zombie maps. This opened up a great deal of new capabilities for the zombie mode as there have been over 100 new custom maps have been designed. Altough it can be fairly tricky to discover the well made, interactive maps as you have to sort through the rushed tacky maps with no objective which are unfortunatley the majority of the maps, obviously this isent a problem with the game itself, just with the autistic braindead ♥♥♥♥♥ who make these ♥♥♥♥♥♥ maps which bareley even work most of the time. My only issue was with the price of the game as i think the £20 price tag is a big cheeky for a game which is 7 years old, would i say it is worth the money? Of course it is if you are a baller like me and have money to spare but if you are on a tight budget that wouldent be the case as frankly i feel that your not getting your moneys worth unless you plan to invest alot of time in to the game. Hope this helped everyone come to a decision if this game is for them. 8---D",1,first played game first came trusty xbox optimistic elements game would play world war two format enjoyable game round immersive campaign challenging yet entertaining unanticipated plot twists multiplayer nice flowing feel large selection unlockable itemsweapons gave sense progression played made want keep playing level character zombie game mode main reason invested game heard interesting things due ability download custom zombie maps opened great deal new capabilities zombie mode new custom maps designed altough fairly tricky discover well made interactive maps sort rushed tacky maps objective unfortunatley majority maps obviously isent problem game autistic braindead make maps bareley even work time issue price game think price tag big cheeky game years old would say worth money course baller like money spare tight budget wouldent case frankly feel getting moneys worth unless plan invest alot time game hope helped everyone come decision game

"7.5/10 Pros:  -Nazi Zombies! -A pretty decent campaign that offers replayability value -Great multiplayer, but it's slowly dying :( -WWII shooter -Great selection of WWII shooters -Focuses on the Pacific Theatre of War for a change  Cons: -For both charaters (Miller and Dmitri) it starts off in 1942 (Makin Raid for Miller, Stalingrad for Dmitri) then all of the sudden it skips to 1944 for Miller and 1945 for Dmitri. So much happened that wasn't explored.  -Sort of branching off from the last con, there was little to no character development. Of course, it's Call of Duty and you play it to shoot down endless waves of bad guys but I think it would have been nice to show changes in characters.  -Historically awkward. For example, the only tanks you see for the Russians is the T-34-85, which makes sense because that was the most produced tank the Russians made but they had dozens of other tank models. They had at least 3 other variants of the T-34, the IS tank series and the SU TD's.  -Rock music in a WWII shooter. wtf? -Gets repititive very quickly  Buy it on sale, 20.00 is steep especially for its age.",1,pros nazi zombies pretty decent campaign offers replayability value great multiplayer slowly dying wwii shooter great selection wwii shooters focuses pacific theatre war change cons charaters miller dmitri starts makin raid miller stalingrad dmitri sudden skips miller dmitri much happened wasnt explored sort branching last con little character development course call duty play shoot endless waves bad guys think would nice show changes characters historically awkward example tanks see russians makes sense produced tank russians made dozens tank models least variants tank series su tds rock music wwii shooter wtf gets repititive quickly buy sale steep especially age

"This game is only ment in my opinion to be modded via Zombies, given that's what it's mostly used for, It suits well in my opinion.  The amount of custom zombie maps for this game is huge, There is even an advanced warfare map, with an exo suit.  Another benifit of this game is that there is no end to the fun you can have, Bored of a map? Try a new one! Another one (yes I know that's a meme) Is that there are still maps coming out at this moment, I found a few of my favorite maps from a youtuber called Relaxing End, He uploads the newest maps with the best content.  Two bad things about the game is  A- The maps CAN be buggy, but usually fun. B- The mutiplayer is the most modded and not fun thing, as hackers are everywhere. So you're basicly buying the game for the zombies.  Still in my opinion, It's worth it.

"The multiplayer is still active and has a lot less hackers and cheaters than any other COD I've played previously. The campaign is still fun and interesting and this is the time when the game was a lot more balanced,shotguns actually killed at close range and killstreaks were limited with less chances of being spawn killed.  A lot of the multiplayer servers are heavily modded so be aware that the modded servers are worth it to unlock your weapons faster and play the game as intended. This is the only time where the flamethrower was truly introduced never to be seen again.  The funniest part about the multiplayer is that there are only three killstreaks to choose from and this is the only time the COD franchise allowed you to take full control of a tank in the multiplayer making it rather ironic seeing as how the use of vehicles was never brought up ever again proving that COD has regressed over time never being innovative and has become the cancer that is known today.

"DON'T FALL FOR NOSTALGIA BIAS  Pros: -classic feel  -people still play it(barely) -no skins(almost)  Cons: -80% of the players are hackers and do not speak english(so no real teamwork) -real servers with the gamemode actually being a CS type are almost non-existant -actual enjoyability comes from whether or not you like to deal with the above  This is one of gamings most treasered games and it is sad to see it get like this. Nostalgia can only get people so far and it is a shame thaat few people explain the reality of this game in their reviews. The fun is not totally gone, although it is something you have to really try to find. The gameplay is as you would expect it (at least when you find a server that doesn't have CSGO surfers on it), nothing has changed and thats good. The problem is the community. It is hard to find a server with a team you can communicate with because of the major language barrier the game now has.  Communication is key in this game as you would expect, and it is very rare because almost everytime you get on a server it is from a central american area and the players mostly speak spanish. Making it difficult as you would expect.   The amount of hacking in this game shameful, it is more common than it is in CSGO and is a real problem that makes the experience more bad than it already has become.  The server types are just like what you would see in an old game, modded to hell with new terribly unenjoyable game modes. If you were to see you would find many gameplay modded servers that give you trash that nobody wants to see (surfing).   Take away the nostalgia bias that everyone tosses out and you will see that this game is a former shell of itself. It has all the elements of a typical old PC game that only a few people will try hard enough to enjoy. The enjoyment can still be found, but at a heavy heavy cost.

"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.",1,experience game type review saying things like great gameplay suit something ive experienced counterstrike go remember back friends house playing game didnt know name game internet find weeks passed another friend came didnt computer brought disc game told one best games moment knew going game saw friends house saw counterstrike logo filled gamegasm happy playing hardcore made friends clans involved communities even made two counterstrike first game played competitively experience playing public servers mods fun playing competitively made intense stressful pleasant way ofcourse looking current esport scene might seem like much back different shooters days try different advanced way sometimes simple games like counterstrike ones live day also plenty mods keep attention game gameplay simple defend counterterrorist attack terrorist plant bomb save hostages ct sure already know doubt gamers havent heard know gameplay counterstrike sharing experience wish could find cs anthology account ive lost since decided going buy game go thousand hours played still play time time day brings back many great memories sometimes even stumble upon people ive played years ago think counterstrike changed gaming major way wouldnt many games like today game wouldnt exist sure many people already played games like csgo never roots doubt play hour much simple differs lot opinion csgo modern games harder though

"Call of Duty is a incredible game, it is the best call of duty game i have played.  Campain: The campain has a great story, being able to play as Miller, a American soldier, and Dimitri, a russion soldier. It takes you through some amazing and breathtaking moments, and it really makes you care and love the charecters in the game. Aswell as some heartbreaking moments towards the end.  Multiplayer: The multiplayer is great on this game. There are a few camping spots and hacked maps, but you will know when somethings wrong. Also be sure not to use certain weapons, as they may well turn out underpowered, where as others are incredibly powerful. So it may take a few experiments :)  Zombies: Zombies is the one reason i bought this game in the first place. It give you chills as you fight through the undead nazi soldiers, if you want some intence moments for a youtube video, this is your game. Also only for PC, you can download custom zombies, which give you more of a variety then the original maps.  I 100% recommend this game to anyone, even people who dont like shooters, play this title, its a true masterpiece.",1,call duty incredible game best call duty game played campain campain great story able play miller american soldier dimitri russion soldier takes amazing breathtaking moments really makes care love charecters game aswell heartbreaking moments towards end multiplayer multiplayer great game camping spots hacked maps know somethings wrong also sure use certain weapons may well turn underpowered others incredibly powerful may take experiments zombies zombies one reason bought game first place give chills fight undead nazi soldiers want intence moments youtube video game also pc download custom zombies give variety original maps recommend game anyone even people dont like shooters play title true masterpiece

Very limited hackers and i ♥♥♥♥ing love it in general. no crazy weapons and or exosuits.just cod4 with a ww2 setting.havnt played zombies yet because im addicted to mp. Plus this has mods.

"Before you criticize my review based on my playtime shown above, I have played this game an absolute ♥♥♥♥ ton on console.  With that being said...  Campaign: It's fun if you're into it.  Multiplayer: Haven't touched it though I assume it's dead.  Zombies: The reason you should get this game. All the DLC is included free of charge so you don't have to mess with paying more for zombie maps. Also, there are tons of custom zombie maps that people have made so you will pretty much never get bored of zombies. The game is incredibly user friendly when loading up custom zombie maps from online so you don't have to install any bull sh*t mods or program to use them. Also, while there are some mediocre zombie maps, there are also a ton of well designed maps that in some cases due to easter eggs or new features outshine the ones that the game comes with. To add, because zombies on Black Ops 1 and 2 aren't exactly mod friendly, custom map makers have turned to integrating a lot of BO1 and BO2 zombies features in World at War. From guns to perks like Mule Kick and extra pack a punch features like cool looking skins for guns when you pack a punch it, these custom maps become more than just a room with spawn points. Hell, there's even buyable endings where you can literally beat the map after you rack up enough points depending on what it's set at (do not confuse buyable with actually having to buy and ending with real money, it's all using the in game points so don't worry about having to pay for extra sh*t. Though this may seem like a lot, or a little if you're a skeptic, this is just a surface level review of what there is to offer in this game through custom zombie maps. You do not have to pay for any map that you download (that I know of) and there's plenty of ways to get these maps. Personally, I just go to youtube and watch well known zombie players playing custom maps that they think are cool and conveniently they link the download to the map. Pretty trusted resource cause, you know, the internet would never lie to me.   Anyways, here's a TL;DR  Get this game mainly for zombies. All DLC included and custom maps are easily available and easy to use. IMO the custom maps are better than the original ones. Worth.  10/10",1,criticize review based playtime shown played game absolute ton console said campaign fun youre multiplayer havent touched though assume dead zombies reason get game dlc included free charge dont mess paying zombie maps also tons custom zombie maps people made pretty much never get bored zombies game incredibly user friendly loading custom zombie maps online dont install bull sht mods program use also mediocre zombie maps also ton well designed maps cases due easter eggs new features outshine ones game comes add zombies black ops arent exactly mod friendly custom map makers turned integrating lot bo bo zombies features world war guns perks like mule kick extra pack punch features like cool looking skins guns pack punch custom maps become room spawn points hell theres even buyable endings literally beat map rack enough points depending set confuse buyable actually buy ending real money using game points dont worry pay extra sht though may seem like lot little youre skeptic surface level review offer game custom zombie maps pay map download know theres plenty ways get maps personally go youtube watch well known zombie players playing custom maps think cool conveniently link download map pretty trusted resource cause know internet would never lie anyways heres tldr get game mainly zombies dlc included custom maps easily available easy use imo custom maps better original ones worth

"Activision's Call of Duty franchise is one of the biggest modern military shooters. But this game, Call of Duty World at War is a bit underrated.

Multiplayer is just the same as Call of Duty 4 but in World War 2. Co-op is amazing it is something we should have in newer Call of Duty games. I couldn't forget this part, ZOMBIES.

"**CAMPAIGN**  With one of the most brutal campaigns in CoD history, WaW really shows the brutality of war. Use flamethrowers to burn down Japanese hideouts, get attacked by attack dog, charged at by Japanese soldiers with bayonets and blow up stuff with tanks. One of my favorite campaigns in the franchise, and also one of the most difficult on the Veteran difficulty, which I recommend you play on for the best experience.  **ZOMBIES**  Overall, I haven't played too much zombies on the PC version, but I played well over 200 hours on my Xbox 360. All of the DLC maps come free with the game, all of which are fantasic and each have different uique mechanics. You can also download TONS of custom zombies maps and play those which are a ton of fun and keep Zombies interesting.  **MULTIPLAYER**  The reason why I bought this game. I went blindly into the game, because not many reviews on here covered the multiplaer very well.   Choose from a giant list of servers, some populated, some not, to play in, all with different rules and settings. A couple of the modes you will find:  - Hardcore, Crouch only. Hardcore, Crouch only servers make up the majority of servers. You are only allowed to move while crouching, unless under direct fire. That means no sprinting anywhere. Most bullets are one shot kill. - Normal Servers The normal rules of the game with little to no regulations. Do what you want. These servers are far less common than Crouch only servers. - Custom Maps Some servers use custom maps instead of the original WaW multiplayer maps. You join the server and before connecting to the game, your client downloads a medium sized file which contains the map, and then you join in. A fun concept I'm sure, but due to my slow internet speeds I am forced to ignore these. - XP Lobbies Unlike most old CoD's which throw you into a random lobby that could have an XP boost that you may or may not want, you can choose if you want an XP lobby. They range from killing stationary bots for XP, to regular games that give you 1000 XP for every kill. Some of these lobbies come with custom settings like high jump and fly, which are fun.  Overall one of my favorite CoD's. Zombies is great, Multiplayer is great, Campaign is fantastic.",1,campaign one brutal campaigns cod history waw really shows brutality war use flamethrowers burn japanese hideouts get attacked attack dog charged japanese soldiers bayonets blow stuff tanks one favorite campaigns franchise also one difficult veteran difficulty recommend play best experience zombies overall havent played much zombies pc version played well hours xbox dlc maps come free game fantasic different uique mechanics also download tons custom zombies maps play ton fun keep zombies interesting multiplayer reason bought game went blindly game many reviews covered multiplaer well choose giant list servers populated play different rules settings couple modes find hardcore crouch hardcore crouch servers make majority servers allowed move crouching unless direct fire means sprinting anywhere bullets one shot kill normal servers normal rules game little regulations want servers far less common crouch servers custom maps servers use custom maps instead original waw multiplayer maps join server connecting game client downloads medium sized file contains map join fun concept im sure due slow internet speeds forced ignore xp lobbies unlike old cods throw random lobby could xp boost may may want choose want xp lobby range killing stationary bots xp regular games give xp every kill lobbies come custom settings like high jump fly fun overall one favorite cods zombies great multiplayer great campaign fantastic

"I honestly have to say I love this game. I will say that sometimes the multiplayer is a little weird and it can be hard to find servers. But what I really love about this game is the zombie mode. Sure it only comes with 4 awesome small to medium sized maps that after a while get a little boring. But, the best part about this game, is custom zombie maps. There are many places you can get awesome and amazing custom zombie maps. My favorite is MrDalekJD's youtube channel. He has a lot of custom zombie map videos. And if you like the map he is playing and want to play it for yourself, then he almost always puts the download link to that map. And, if your tired of the same guns, some zombie maps have different weapons, like weapons from MW2. I highly recommend buying this game. Especially if your computer isn't exactly gamer-quality. If your computer isn't gamer quality but you still want to enjoy some good Ol' Call of Duty games then I would recommend getting World at War, Black Ops, and Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. Here is a link to MrDalekJD'S youtube channel for awesome gameplays and zombie maps:  https://www.youtube.com/user/MrDalekJD  Also BANZAI ALL THE TIME!!! In the campaign japanese men try to kill you with bayonets while running at you and yelling BUNZAI.

"Call of Duty: World at War, also referred to as Call of Duty 5 or simply World at War, and abbreviated as CoD: WaW or WaW, is a first-person shooter game produced by Treyarch, and is the first game in the 'Black Ops' timeline. It was released on November 11, 2008 in North America and on November 14, 2008 in Europe. It was announced on December 2, 2007, and on June 6, 2008; the 64th anniversary of D-Day, Treyarch announced it would be named as 'World at War' and it would take place in the Pacific theater of war as well as the Eastern Front.  There is one campaign in the game divided into two: the American campaign and the Soviet campaign. The Soviet campaign is returning after having last been present in Call of Duty 2. There is no British campaign in the game, making World at War the only major Call of Duty set in the Second World War not to feature a British Campaign or a British playable character. It features both a solo and co-op campaign, however both are the same except that co-op is played with multiple people and certain missions are absoloutly unplayable.  The American campaign is set in the Pacific theater on the islands of Makin, Peleliu, and Okinawa. The Soviet campaign is set in the Eastern Front, mainly in Nazi Germany. In the American campaign, players take the role of Pvt. C. Miller as he fights alongside Sgt. Tom Sullivan, Cpl. Roebuck (later Sergeant), and Pvt. Polonsky. In the Soviet campaign, players take the role of Pvt. Dimitri Petrenko as he fights alongside the merciless Sgt. Viktor Reznov and the merciful Pvt. Chernov. In the American campaign, players, for the first time in a Call of Duty game, fight against the Japanese Imperial Army. Most combat takes place in jungles, where ambushes are likely. Combat also takes place in small mortar pits, ridges, beach heads, Japanese trenches, and small villages. Bunkers are a common sight in the American campaign, usually causing heavy casualties. In the Soviet Campaign, players fight against the German Wehrmacht during the push towards Berlin. Combat takes place, at first, in the ruins of Stalingrad where the player is mainly a sniper. After that, combat occurs in farmland and forests of the German town of Seelow, and finally Berlin is assaulted and close quarter fighting becomes a common feature. The last mission of the Soviet campaign sees the Red Army capture the Reichstag and the player planting the Soviet Flag on top of the building.",1,call duty world war also referred call duty simply world war abbreviated cod waw waw firstperson shooter game produced treyarch first game black ops timeline released november north america november europe announced december june th anniversary dday treyarch announced would named world war would take place pacific theater war well eastern front one campaign game divided two american campaign soviet campaign soviet campaign returning last present call duty british campaign game making world war major call duty set second world war feature british campaign british playable character features solo coop campaign however except coop played multiple people certain missions absoloutly unplayable american campaign set pacific theater islands makin peleliu okinawa soviet campaign set eastern front mainly nazi germany american campaign players take role pvt c miller fights alongside sgt tom sullivan cpl roebuck later sergeant pvt polonsky soviet campaign players take role pvt dimitri petrenko fights alongside merciless sgt viktor reznov merciful pvt chernov american campaign players first time call duty game fight japanese imperial army combat takes place jungles ambushes likely combat also takes place small mortar pits ridges beach heads japanese trenches small villages bunkers common sight american campaign usually causing heavy casualties soviet campaign players fight german wehrmacht push towards berlin combat takes place first ruins stalingrad player mainly sniper combat occurs farmland forests german town seelow finally berlin assaulted close quarter fighting becomes common feature last mission soviet campaign sees red army capture reichstag player planting soviet flag top building

"This was the best WW2 shooter to DATE. It was the barebones of Call Of Duty that brings me back to a time of the perfect balance of customization and simplicity. The zombies, fantastic, the formula was perfect and did not need to be tampered with at all. This game with its lengthy campaign in the Pacific and in Eastern Europe, really gave you the sense of fighting while enjoying co-op and Death Cards. Multiplayer was something of greatness, hours of my days were swept away with it, and with the 3 most perfect, simplistic kill streak rewards of a Recon Plane, Artillery, and Dogs was just amazing and made you keep playing. The only downside I see with this game is when you achieve dogs without using your Artillery, you lose the previous Killstreak. But Only demotes it to a solid 9/10",1,best ww shooter date barebones call duty brings back time perfect balance customization simplicity zombies fantastic formula perfect need tampered game lengthy campaign pacific eastern europe really gave sense fighting enjoying coop death cards multiplayer something greatness hours days swept away perfect simplistic kill streak rewards recon plane artillery dogs amazing made keep playing downside see game achieve dogs without using artillery lose previous killstreak demotes solid

"I have a story to tell, might get nostalgic to some of you so sit down and grab a drink. Back in 2009, i was at my cousins house playing out in the yard, then his bigger brother left his room to go walking with the older cousins, leaving just me, my cousin(we'll call cathal) and my other cousin Aaron. Now we went in his room and found his Xbox 360 and a so we turned it on. The game inside, Call of Duty: World at War. We decided to play and when we got on, we choose multiplayer and played with the split screen mode ond choose one of my favourite maps, Castle. We would camp at the two main buildings snipping with the PTRS-41 and using the other pre-made classes. After we played for a few hours, his brother came back and we left to go back outside. I went home asking my dad if i can get this game call Call of duty. HE said sure. Ever since that day, my life was consumed by first person shooters. I got it for the Wii btw. Each day i would go onto My wii and play WAW. Then i got an Xbox 360 and Xbox live. THats when i met people from around Ireland or the UK (i live in Australia now). I would play Multiplayer for hours, Zombies for hours, replay that mission where istill will never figure out how to shot Amirch Hamsel with a pistol from that range like wtf. Tehn i got the MW series, Black ops which i loved just as much and Halo Games which came with the 360. Now, 7 years later, im 16. I play Counter Strike and other games on my 360. However, every so often, ill boot up WAW, MW, BO, to relive distant memories. Remembering all my friends who i would add to platy COD with, Friends who i miss so much, Friends who ill never talk to again. But in the end, Call of Duty is an old classic you boot up on a Saturday evening to play with friends, have a laugh to escape life drama. Ill miss the old days, Split Screening, The PPSH-41, The sense of the Japense charging with a BANZAI. The fall of that german soilder on top of the reighstag, the sense of sniping 7 soilders and a dog with 5 bullets. Ill miss COD back in the late 2000s and early 2010s. I love this game 10/10 :')",1,story tell might get nostalgic sit grab drink back cousins house playing yard bigger brother left room go walking older cousins leaving cousinwell call cathal cousin aaron went room found xbox turned game inside call duty world war decided play got choose multiplayer played split screen mode ond choose one favourite maps castle would camp two main buildings snipping ptrs using premade classes played hours brother came back left go back outside went home asking dad get game call call duty said sure ever since day life consumed first person shooters got wii btw day would go onto wii play waw got xbox xbox live thats met people around ireland uk live australia would play multiplayer hours zombies hours replay mission istill never figure shot amirch hamsel pistol range like wtf tehn got mw series black ops loved much halo games came years later im play counter strike games however every often ill boot waw mw bo relive distant memories remembering friends would add platy cod friends miss much friends ill never talk end call duty old classic boot saturday evening play friends laugh escape life drama ill miss old days split screening ppsh sense japense charging banzai fall german soilder top reighstag sense sniping soilders dog bullets ill miss cod back late early love game

In most of the cases it's pure luck speaking but hey, who cares. At least you made a headshot and had a one round of glory!  Only downside is the server list, which is hijacked and showing fake servers. Use gametracker or other sites like that to see the real servers.

"Technically the second best Call of Duty game of all time, it also happens to be my favourite.   Visuals 10/10 : I love the original level design of the game's Pacific setting, giving it almost a Vietnam War era atmoshere. The textures are composed of AAA quality and the maps can be very expansive.   Sound 10/10 : This is the best soundtrack in any CoD game. An original orchestra-inspired soundtrack is delivered subtely adding a perfect atmosphere. The melody of the Nazi Zombie lobby will always be remembered fondly. All sound effects are of the highest quality and deliver the player in an immensely audial war experience.   Gameplay 9/10 : The single player campaign is an enjoyable ride with voice acting from the likes of Hollywood actor Keither Sutherland. The level design of the campaign is incredibly detailed (from ruined sections of Europe to the fresh subtropical scenery of the Pacific War) as well as some vast multiplayer maps to conquer. The reason this CoD is my favourite though? A little thing called Nazi Zombies, one of the best video game zombie experiences to date, with a steady learning curve that is easy to pick up but very hard to master. The teamwork of Nazi Zombies is one of the strongest applications of micro teamwork in a video game. This makes it a favourite.

I've literally sunk close to 15,000 hours into the various derivations of CS over the years.  I found out about CS from some #IRC chat I used to frequent back in the day(it might have been an ICQ chat with one of them). Namely, I started with the first ALPHA(yea, not beta, ALPHA). I can recall the loading screen and everything. From there, I progressed through the initial betas, introduction of maps, and various weapons(anyone remember the OLD cs_siege, complete with working apc and sniper tower?), etc.  I then became a player in various 'leagues'; I won't name drop, but I was a baller at one time.  So, yes, this game is good. Some people recommend CSGO as the 'modern' return of 1.6, but I disagree. CSGO is better than CSS, yes, but still not on-par with 1.6, nothing will ever be :(  Goodbye WON-servers.",1,despite hilariously low count hours record attest nay played gameand sequels ends time ive literally sunk close hours various derivations cs years found cs irc chat used frequent back dayit might icq chat one namely started first alphayea beta alpha recall loading screen everything progressed initial betas introduction maps various weaponsanyone remember old cssiege complete working apc sniper tower etc became player various leagues wont name drop baller one time yes game good people recommend csgo modern return disagree csgo better css yes still onpar nothing ever goodbye wonservers

"Silo is not the best tool on the market, but any experienced 3D artist will agree that there is no equivalent to a 'panacea' in the 3D-modeling fields. Silo is a focused polygonal modeling tool with some limited sculting capabilities and that pretty much covers it. It has UV-unwrapping functionality as well, but it is painfully inadequate and very difficult to work with.  Silo's primary strength lies in its user friendliness and how simple, fast and reliable you can build a high-quality mesh of either a lowpoly or highpoly nature. Creating a character mesh by manipulating Silo's great subdivision functions and adding details with the paint displacement tool is nothing new that you would not be able to do in 3DS Max or Blender, but it is the ease of doing so in Silo that sets it apart from its competitors.  This tool is not for everyone and I recommend trying it before you buy it.",1,silo best tool market experienced artist agree equivalent panacea dmodeling fields silo focused polygonal modeling tool limited sculting capabilities pretty much covers uvunwrapping functionality well painfully inadequate difficult work silos primary strength lies user friendliness simple fast reliable build highquality mesh either lowpoly highpoly nature creating character mesh manipulating silos great subdivision functions adding details paint displacement tool nothing new would able ds max blender ease silo sets apart competitors tool everyone recommend trying buy

"Call of Duty: World at War - The 5th Installment in the Call of Duty Series  The vanilla game comes with three different modes: multiplayer, campaign and zombies.  If you are buying this game for the campaign or multiplayer, I would recommend going for a different game such as Call of Duty 4. That game on PC has a much better package for those who like these two features. Regardless, the campaign on this game is phenominal and is worth playing through at least once. Likewise, the multiplayer is good but there are not always a lot of people on. The severs are dedicated, so each server is ran by someone in the world. This means that there is a plethora of custom content added to each server, making the multiplayer both fun and diverse. However, despite all of this, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND buying this game if you are a zombies fan. You will absolutely not regret it.  After 700+ hours and countless maps, this game has brought nothing but enjoyment. It is safe to say that this game is probably the longest lasting and most exciting Call of Duty for PC. While its community is small, the amount of dedication that is put into this game and its custom content is phenominal. There is still content coming out today and each map is filled with mixed emotions, whether it is the sigh of distress from a new box map to the amazement of Black Ops 3-esque level of detail in maps.  Looking at where custom maps started until now, we were able to add new perks (from existing Call of Duty titles and from our imaginations), add buildables, add new guns and create a new format for playing zombies. Buyable endings have become a norm, swiftly replacing that of high rounds in order to increase some maps replayability. Comparatively, these easter eggs generally take a day or two to figure out by some, but are extremely satisfying if found by ones self.  For those looking for places to find good custom maps:  ugx-mods.com  (for the newest and latest custom zombie maps)  zombiemodding.com  (for the largest bank of custom maps)  zommods.com  (for the generally more popular custom maps)  Any other site not mentioned usually overlaps these sites in content.  Regardless of your experience in zombies, this game is definitely for the zombies fanatic. All skill levels are met. If you are a hardcore fan, there are plenty of great/difficult custom maps. If you are just learning, or not that good, there are a ton of box maps to begin learning the game on.  In my opinion, if you are looking to get: World at War, Black Ops 1, Black Ops 2, Black Ops 3 ----- Get World at War. It's face value is a surpreme bargain. There are at least 1000 maps so it is well worth it over the other zombie games.   This opinion may change in the future as Black Ops 1 is slowly gaining steam toward custom maps (it already has some great custom mods though, and in my opinion custom maps is pretty late for that game) and Black Ops 3 is going to be getting mod tools soon for the public. With what has been shown, Black Ops 3 will more than likely become World at War's successor in terms of custom zombies. So look towards purchasing that game once we get some more information. The possibilities will be endless for that game.  Overall, I give this game an 7/10 for the vanilla game for PC specifically, (4 zombies maps/Multiplayer/Campaign) because of how many people are online at the moment and what you will be getting for face value.  When you take all of the custom content in consideration I would give the game an easy 10/10.   Think about it, you would be paying $20 USD, or 10-15 on sale days, for a game with hundreds of custom maps, equating to 1000's of hours of play time. It is a deal you can not pass up on.  10/10 -UltzZ  ",1,call duty world war th installment call duty series vanilla game comes three different modes multiplayer campaign zombies buying game campaign multiplayer would recommend going different game call duty game pc much better package like two features regardless campaign game phenominal worth playing least likewise multiplayer good always lot people severs dedicated server ran someone world means plethora custom content added server making multiplayer fun diverse however despite would highly recommend buying game zombies fan absolutely regret hours countless maps game brought nothing enjoyment safe say game probably longest lasting exciting call duty pc community small amount dedication put game custom content phenominal still content coming today map filled mixed emotions whether sigh distress new box map amazement black ops esque level detail maps looking custom maps started able add new perks existing call duty titles imaginations add buildables add new guns create new format playing zombies buyable endings become norm swiftly replacing high rounds order increase maps replayability comparatively easter eggs generally take day two figure extremely satisfying found ones self looking places find good custom maps ugxmodscom newest latest custom zombie maps zombiemoddingcom largest bank custom maps zommodscom generally popular custom maps site mentioned usually overlaps sites content regardless experience zombies game definitely zombies fanatic skill levels met hardcore fan plenty greatdifficult custom maps learning good ton box maps begin learning game opinion looking get world war black ops black ops black ops get world war face value surpreme bargain least maps well worth zombie games opinion may change future black ops slowly gaining steam toward custom maps already great custom mods though opinion custom maps pretty late game black ops going getting mod tools soon public shown black ops likely become world wars successor terms custom zombies look towards purchasing game get information possibilities endless game overall give game vanilla game pc specifically zombies mapsmultiplayercampaign many people online moment getting face value take custom content consideration would give game easy think would paying usd sale days game hundreds custom maps equating hours play time deal pass ultzz

"Hello, if you are going to buy this game again after migrating from Xbox, please take a few notes. If you happened to play World at War during the next annualized release, at which point they stopped updating/patching the game and went on with the next, you'd know that even on consoles this game was riddled with hackers of all kind. Wallhackers, aimbotters, rainbow names and such. The game has not changed on PC, and they are doing nothing to stop this, so unless you have absolutely no soul I would completely avoid Multiplayer. Keep in mind the game is not entirely pointless to buy. Most get it simply just for zombies, and while there is no mod support it seems Treyarch is fine with custom maps and zombies-type gamemodes, but the downside is that there will be absolutely no vanilla servers if not playing with friends. This is kind of where it gets excrutiating after purchasing the game, as playing Vanilla was the first thing I wanted to do. Der Reise servers seem to be your best bet if looking to play vanilla, as it's such a good map that those who mod Zombies servers seem to not mess with it. Playing with friends seems to be one of the only ways to truly have fun, so if you lack the friends, either visit discussions and add someone or make friends with people on Zombies servers. As said before, do not even try to play multiplayer in it's dead state. There are little to no actual, true players in it anymore and I doubt there ever will be again. Even servers with no hacks on seem to have Double XP on, which completely ruins the build-up and fun of multiplayer in the first place.  Campaign: 8/10. Multiplayer: Dead, kicked into a ditch, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ on and lit on fire. Many negative numbers/10 Zombies: 9/10, godmodders and such are present, otherwise vanilla it is one of the best games ever made.",-1,hello going buy game migrating xbox please take notes happened play world war next annualized release point stopped updatingpatching game went next youd know even consoles game riddled hackers kind wallhackers aimbotters rainbow names game changed pc nothing stop unless absolutely soul would completely avoid multiplayer keep mind game entirely pointless buy get simply zombies mod support seems treyarch fine custom maps zombiestype gamemodes downside absolutely vanilla servers playing friends kind gets excrutiating purchasing game playing vanilla first thing wanted der reise servers seem best bet looking play vanilla good map mod zombies servers seem mess playing friends seems one ways truly fun lack friends either visit discussions add someone make friends people zombies servers said even try play multiplayer dead state little actual true players anymore doubt ever even servers hacks seem double xp completely ruins buildup fun multiplayer first place campaign multiplayer dead kicked ditch lit fire many negative numbers zombies godmodders present otherwise vanilla one best games ever made

"Yes, I know Black Ops 3 just came out, but this game is still good. If you want a decent campaign and a great multiplayer, look here. The campaign has lots of blood, guts, action, and explosions to suit your needs. Who wouldn't want to burn people with flamethrowers and take off their limbs with shotguns. And the best thing about the gore is that it is in all the modes! Multiplayer gives out a fun experience as well. The guns and perks give a good nostalgic feel. If you haven't played the game you might wanna try and see how good the multiplayer is. It may not compete with the modern Call Of Dutys but it is worth $20. And lastly, the reason everyone bought this game, zombies! Zombies is the best out of the whole game. Zombies in this game is worth more than $20. If you don't know what zombies is here is a description. You start off on round 1. On round 1 you kill all the zombies. Then comes round 2. So on and so forth. But, the catch is you upgrade your character by getting perks and better guns. Perks are essentialy upgrades. For example, if you buy Speed Cola you reload faster. See how this can be fun. The game comes with 4 maps. Each zombie map is different in it's ways. But the catch is, you can mod user made maps in the game! The users make better maps than Treyarch by far. Just look up a youtube tutorial and you will be playing brilliant zombie maps in five minutes. That is why YOU should get Call Of Duty World At War.",1,yes know black ops came game still good want decent campaign great multiplayer look campaign lots blood guts action explosions suit needs wouldnt want burn people flamethrowers take limbs shotguns best thing gore modes multiplayer gives fun experience well guns perks give good nostalgic feel havent played game might wanna try see good multiplayer may compete modern call dutys worth lastly reason everyone bought game zombies zombies best whole game zombies game worth dont know zombies description start round round kill zombies comes round forth catch upgrade character getting perks better guns perks essentialy upgrades example buy speed cola reload faster see fun game comes maps zombie map different ways catch mod user made maps game users make better maps treyarch far look youtube tutorial playing brilliant zombie maps five minutes get call duty world war

"Ok, I admit, I played this game back in my childhood on my original Xbox, and had so much fun. Not too long ago I reinstalled it for my computer, but when I did, I HATED it. I couldn't play right. People would one tap me from the side of the map, others will just be an absolute pro with the AWP making life so hard. Theres no mercy for new players, there's no official Valve servers, only the community servers which take away the classic feel. I have probably only joined 2 servers that have none of the stupid annoying Quake sounds. No 'double kill' or 'dominating' just classic CS 1.6. It was aggrovating for me, my favourite childhood game gone to waste, or so I thought. I was just bad at the game. I was scared to do anything. If I pushed in first, I thought I would get destroyed immediately. The guns felt weird and ridiculously inaccurate, the game didn't FEEL right, and anything I tried would ultimately fail. Well, until a couple of weeks ago.   I played violent. I played smart. I played gruesome and unforgiving. Getting 4 man spray downs and one-double tap headshots across the map. I was ruthless, relentless, and I enjoyed it. This game was starting to be fun for me, not as annoying, not as frustrating, only fun, as I always wanted it to be. The thing is I learned not to be scared, the same with CSGO. I played CSGO, sucked at it, played horribly until I just began to not care if I died. That was when I began to play better. CS 1.6 came, and I began to be horrifying. Enemy teams would scream at me, I would laugh and continue, their unfornate moments was fuel to my wrath, until, of course as it always happens, a pro AWPer comes towards me and 420 swagscopes me in the face. Rage quit.  11/10 would get Blazed it again.",1,ok admit played game back childhood original xbox much fun long ago reinstalled computer hated couldnt play right people would one tap side map others absolute pro awp making life hard theres mercy new players theres official valve servers community servers take away classic feel probably joined servers none stupid annoying quake sounds double kill dominating classic cs aggrovating favourite childhood game gone waste thought bad game scared anything pushed first thought would get destroyed immediately guns felt weird ridiculously inaccurate game didnt feel right anything tried would ultimately fail well couple weeks ago played violent played smart played gruesome unforgiving getting man spray downs onedouble tap headshots across map ruthless relentless enjoyed game starting fun annoying frustrating fun always wanted thing learned scared csgo played csgo sucked played horribly began care died began play better cs came began horrifying enemy teams would scream would laugh continue unfornate moments fuel wrath course always happens pro awper comes towards swagscopes face rage quit would get blazed

"I bought Silo back when it was only $80 and during a 40% off sale so I didn't spend much. But now the full price is $119.99 without any real updates - WTF?!? For the price and considering Silo is abandonware I simply cannot recommend Silo. Instead I'd recommend Blender (free) or Modo Indie (cheap).  I originally purchased Silo for at home modeling. Although experienced and trained in 3ds Max and Maya those are just too expensive. I had also first tried Blender but was so put off by the user interface that I ended up buying Silo. This turned out to be a mistake because I ended up revisiting Blender went thru some free tutorials on cgcookie website and Blender became easier to use. Blender might take longer to learn but the reward is that it is more powerful and faster to work with once you learn it.  Right now I have over 50 hours in Modo Indie. Modo is the best modeling software I have ever used. Ever. Better than 3ds Max and that is saying a lot because I love 3ds Max. Modo Indie's Meshfusion and Procedural Modeling is simply amazing - look on youtube for demonstrations. Modeling in Modo is 20 times better and 5 to 10 times faster than working in Silo. Modo Indie is available at low monthly subscription cost or full license. The full price of Modo indie is $299 and if you compare price and features to Silo it's a no brainer. With Modo you are getting not only better modeling and uv tools - you can also texture, sculpt, animate and render with a high quality ray traced renderer. And to top it off Modo has an awesome user interface. (If you want to purchase a full license for Modo wait for a sale.)  I'd only recommend Silo if it were free especially since the developer is putting zero time into it. Both Blender and Modo are actively being developed.",-1,bought silo back sale didnt spend much full price without real updates wtf price considering silo abandonware simply cannot recommend silo instead id recommend blender free modo indie cheap originally purchased silo home modeling although experienced trained ds max maya expensive also first tried blender put user interface ended buying silo turned mistake ended revisiting blender went thru free tutorials cgcookie website blender became easier use blender might take longer learn reward powerful faster work learn right hours modo indie modo best modeling software ever used ever better ds max saying lot love ds max modo indies meshfusion procedural modeling simply amazing look youtube demonstrations modeling modo times better times faster working silo modo indie available low monthly subscription cost full license full price modo indie compare price features silo brainer modo getting better modeling uv tools also texture sculpt animate render high quality ray traced renderer top modo awesome user interface want purchase full license modo wait sale id recommend silo free especially since developer putting zero time blender modo actively developed

THE BEST ♥♥♥♥ING GAME IVE EVER PLAYED ZOMBIES THOUGH ,1,best ing game ive ever played zombies though
"I myself have never been what most would consider to be a 'Gamer', which from a statement such as that stems quite a bit of irony. Years ago i started off drawing Dragon Ball Z characters in 3rd grade with my friends, and somehow evolved into a freelance graphic designer/concept artist. I've always been fascinated, if not infatuated with video games. ive been playing games ever since an older cousin of mine gave us kids his old nintendo, later followed by a playstation christmas gift. So i have my share of experience when it comes to the development of games, and a fair understand of what makes a game, a game throughout my console based endeavors. I started PC gaming for the sole purpose of playing a certain game i was a part of production with at the time, and came to fathom the incomparable differenve between playing an fps with a control, and fighting off multiple fellas with a plain old logitech mouse. By now means do i own a machine that is so badass it would tell battlefield to shutup soooo hard that it finally becomes next gen.. but playing this game, with the infinite maps, and the involved modding communtiy around it, not including the long nights i've spent with my buddy, which all started out by lookin to pass the time, and suddenly, it would be the next day. Fabulouse game. as much as my Fps can fluctuation so sporadically that im pretty sure it can be measure with a seismic monitor, and my guess is that its about a 4 on the richter scale.

"You can ignore me for my play time, but from what I've played, this is really great.   But we all know why you're here. Zombies.

Campaign and multiplayer you might, but that's because guns are blazing.   Zombies is straight up lagless. Only hints of lag are mystery box, but you shouldn't be looking at the box during the sequence.   But just think about it. All those mods you could play. All the themed maps with zombies.

"Multiplayer is good but WAYYYYY too many:  - modders  - 10 year olds asking for 'infections'  Campaign:  - easily one of the best cod campaign I've played. One of my favorites, up there with black ops 1 campaign (I adored that campaign)  Zombies: (this is where this game SHINES)  - there are 4 maps that come with the game, as follows;  - Nacht Der Untoten  - Verruckt  - Shi No Numa  - Der Riese  Nacht is a very basic map. No perks or pack a punch, very close quarters. All you'll have is a mystery box and your skills.  Verruckt is an insane asylum. If you're new, you probably won't make it to round 5. Hard to train because it's extremely close quarters, and the first and only map to have zombies that sprint as fast as the player SPRINTING.  Shi No Numa is a swampy map with huts and a little zipline sort of transport. It also features the wonder weapon the 'Wunderwaffe' (sorry if mispelled) which is a powerful gun that shoots a bolt of lightning, instantly destroying zombies and chaining to others around it. It's only available from the box.  Der Riese is my favorite map. It's a research factory sort of place that is one of the bigger maps. It features hellhounds that come every 5 or so rounds, dropping max ammo (I believe shi no numa and MAYBE verruckt has these aswell) everytime you fight them off. Also features the ray gun, but all the maps have that. Tip: Watch out for the splash damage.  The zombies is easily one of the best parts of the this game. Challenging, but a blast to play solo or with friends.  Also not to mention custom zombies maps you can download which are usually entertaining.  Some recommended custom maps:  - Zebba Farms  - Jays Baseball Field  - YAW Valentines  Easily a must buy game.",1,multiplayer good wayyyyy many modders year olds asking infections campaign easily one best cod campaign ive played one favorites black ops campaign adored campaign zombies game shines maps come game follows nacht der untoten verruckt shi numa der riese nacht basic map perks pack punch close quarters youll mystery box skills verruckt insane asylum youre new probably wont make round hard train extremely close quarters first map zombies sprint fast player sprinting shi numa swampy map huts little zipline sort transport also features wonder weapon wunderwaffe sorry mispelled powerful gun shoots bolt lightning instantly destroying zombies chaining others around available box der riese favorite map research factory sort place one bigger maps features hellhounds come every rounds dropping max ammo believe shi numa maybe verruckt aswell everytime fight also features ray gun maps tip watch splash damage zombies easily one best parts game challenging blast play solo friends also mention custom zombies maps download usually entertaining recommended custom maps zebba farms jays baseball field yaw valentines easily must buy game

"Even to this day, Call of Duty: World at War holds its own, as a solid, and entertaining entry in the Call of Duty franchise. The game features a story with a powerful message: that war is brutal. The multiplayer, while not revolutionary, should be praised for its contributions as a stepping stone to later Call of Duty games. Zombies is entertaining, though somewhat bland compared to what would come later, but it does bring back nostalgia to those days when you would sit down with a friend, and test your skill against the hordes.   I did experience some glitches in Campaign, like Resnov taking cover and never moving forward, making it impossible to progress through the story (which was fixed after a restart of the mission).   Overall, Call of Duty: World at War is a solid, and entertaining game, that features a visually powerful story, a solid multiplayer mode, and a zombies mode that will make the hours go by.  Final Rating: 8/10",1,even day call duty world war holds solid entertaining entry call duty franchise game features story powerful message war brutal multiplayer revolutionary praised contributions stepping stone later call duty games zombies entertaining though somewhat bland compared would come later bring back nostalgia days would sit friend test skill hordes experience glitches campaign like resnov taking cover never moving forward making impossible progress story fixed restart mission overall call duty world war solid entertaining game features visually powerful story solid multiplayer mode zombies mode make hours go final rating

"I know I've only played this game for two hours on PC, but I already know what this game is all about from playing both the PS3 and 360 versions of it for years.   After experiencing all the annoying ♥♥♥♥ that's plagued the console versions of WaW, the PC version was a refreshing change from all the god mode, no clip, infection, infinite ammo, XP hacking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s on consoles.   Another major bonus of WaW on PC is custom zombies which, after being able to play as a shotgun wielding Patrick Star shooting up dozens of Bubble Buddy zombies, further solidified my love for WaW on PC.   All in all, if you're a console gamer looking to escape the mess that is WaW on consoles, get yourself a decent PC, buy this game (preferably when it's on sale because $9.99 is a hell of a lot better than paying $19.99 for an almost eight year old game), and enjoy WaW before it went to ♥♥♥♥ on consoles.   Oh, one word of advice for console gamers wanting to play this version of WaW, the mouse and keyboard makes it easier to aim in this game so don't be surprised when you get sniped dozens of times out of nowhere immediately after you spawn.   10/10 would pop hundreds of bubble buddies with a shotgun and get sniped out of nowhere immediately after spawning again.",1,know ive played game two hours pc already know game playing ps versions years experiencing annoying thats plagued console versions waw pc version refreshing change god mode clip infection infinite ammo xp hacking consoles another major bonus waw pc custom zombies able play shotgun wielding patrick star shooting dozens bubble buddy zombies solidified love waw pc youre console gamer looking escape mess waw consoles get decent pc buy game preferably sale hell lot better paying almost eight year old game enjoy waw went consoles oh one word advice console gamers wanting play version waw mouse keyboard makes easier aim game dont surprised get sniped dozens times nowhere immediately spawn would pop hundreds bubble buddies shotgun get sniped nowhere immediately spawning

Of course teamgame on this mostly dissapeared, people play only by theirselves, but that's good, you know why? You will never get nervous if your teammate fails to defuse the bomb or something like that, because you play by yourself. Talking about game modes, oh God there are so much modes, starting from Surf ending with Zombie Plague. You can play this with your friends easily, cause there are no rank restrictions. The ban system and other things like amx_ban or amx_kick are highly fixed and upgraded at maximum. You can put whatever skins you want from CS:GO and so on, and use it without any restrictions.

"Yeah... the old Counter-Strike.... Everybody know, what CS is.. Counter-Strike - My rating - 9/10   Why or Why not to play this old classic ?  Positive:  It´s a legendary game, and if u playing games like CS:GO etc. u will like it, cause it will be legendary in your library. Almost everybody played CS 1.6 'from start his cs:go career' Counter-Strike 1.6 is latest and best version on the game, and if u purchase CS, u can play it, if u will download it, there´s is some chance, that u cant play it (Win 8 etc).  Most of legens/pro´s in CS:GO played CS 1.6, it´s like beginning, and it could be your beginning!   Negative: No more good tournaments on CS 1.6 (On CS:GO are tournaments like EMS, Dreamhack etc.) Graphic+Gameplay - Graphic sucks... but its still better then WarZ:P Gameplay.... yeah, crouching sucks, aiming sucks... u know... bad gameplay, if u see CS:GO, when is all so smooth, u will hate CS 1.6... but if u play CS 1.6 before then CS:GO, its good for you, and u will like it (probably:D)  So... my opinion is: It´s legendary game, everyone, who likes FPS must have this in his/her:P steam library. :)   ",1,yeah old counterstrike everybody know cs counterstrike rating play old classic positive legendary game u playing games like csgo etc u like cause legendary library almost everybody played cs start csgo career counterstrike latest best version game u purchase cs u play u download theres chance u cant play win etc legenspros csgo played cs like beginning could beginning negative good tournaments cs csgo tournaments like ems dreamhack etc graphicgameplay graphic sucks still better warzp gameplay yeah crouching sucks aiming sucks u know bad gameplay u see csgo smooth u hate cs u play cs csgo good u like probablyd opinion legendary game everyone likes fps must hisherp steam library

The map design is great. There is usually one massive firefight area, and a few choke points you want to hold. It feels balanced.

Campaign is good, with characters that you grow attached to and are affected by their death    like Chernov   , and a compelling story.  But who cares about all that?

"Nazi Zombies is quite honestly THE selling point for this title. The competitive multiplayer is just as entertaining as Modern Warfare 1, but honestly, doesn't push the series forward in any major way. They added vehicles, but it's not as impressive as you might hope. The maps are pretty decent designed, though, and the variety is a refreshing change from all the bland browness of MW1. Black Ops has continued several of the perks that began here but were ignored by IW for MW2, including Second Chance, which was a modified Last Stand. Instead of just being able to shoot whilst down, if another teammate has spawned with Second Chance selected, they can revive you before you completely bleed out. I really liked that perk. Regardless, it does allow you to level up during LAN play, so it's probably the last CoD game that will support that. If it goes on sale, I still think you should pick it up.",1,nazi zombies quite honestly selling point title competitive multiplayer entertaining modern warfare honestly doesnt push series forward major way added vehicles impressive might hope maps pretty decent designed though variety refreshing change bland browness mw black ops continued several perks began ignored iw mw including second chance modified last stand instead able shoot whilst another teammate spawned second chance selected revive completely bleed really liked perk regardless allow level lan play probably last cod game support goes sale still think pick

"Best Call of Duty of the Series in my opinion.

Not only this, but there are a ton of cool mods to try out to improve the experience.",1,best call duty series opinion appeals last cod installment set ww provides player average campaign really good multiplayer provided find match without modders far best zombies maps series brought something properly innovative upon release improved gameplay something modern zombies iterations fail ton cool mods try improve experience

"This game is the main reason why I bought a gaming pc 4 years ago. It's easily my favorite game, if you couldn't tell by my almost 200 hours played, and i'll tell you why.  Reason 1. Custom Zombies: I love Call of Duty Zombies. It's my favorite game mode in any game ever made. However, sometimes the old treyarch maps get old, even on the newer games, and you crave a new map. Here on PC Call of Duty World at War, you can choose from hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions of great custom maps- Not to mention that you can make your own!  Reason 2. World War 2 games are great.  Reason 3. On xbox 360 and ps3, everyone mods call of duty World at War multiplayer, making it completely unplayable in my opinion. On Call of Duty World at War on PC, i'm yet to find someone running around World at War multiplayer with a Rainbow name who flies around in godmode during the game. Thanks punkbuster for perserving the greatest COD multiplayer ever!  Reason 4. The campaign is solid. It's put together well, and actually makes sense unlike the newer call of duty campaigns.   Reason 5. You could run this game on a potato. You don't need some fancy gtx 980Ti or anything to run this game, a 720 will run it perfect at maximum settings (I would know I used to have one).  Reason 6. The value. It's the best $20 game you will ever purchase, and sometimes it goes on sale for $10.  I could go on forever. The fact is if I had to choose to keep one game in my library, I would choose Call of Duty World at War.",1,game main reason bought gaming pc years ago easily favorite game couldnt tell almost hours played ill tell reason custom zombies love call duty zombies favorite game mode game ever made however sometimes old treyarch maps get old even newer games crave new map pc call duty world war choose hundreds thousands maybe even millions great custom maps mention make reason world war games great reason xbox ps everyone mods call duty world war multiplayer making completely unplayable opinion call duty world war pc im yet find someone running around world war multiplayer rainbow name flies around godmode game thanks punkbuster perserving greatest cod multiplayer ever reason campaign solid put together well actually makes sense unlike newer call duty campaigns reason could run game potato dont need fancy gtx ti anything run game run perfect maximum settings would know used one reason value best game ever purchase sometimes goes sale could go forever fact choose keep one game library would choose call duty world war

"The best thing I love about this game is the full campaign coop! You can play coop with your friend for the story campaign from start to the end. The campaign story is quite interesting, and contains a lot of different aspect of war for you to experience: like being a captured hostage waiting to be executed, using a flamethrower to burn enemy fortress, shooting snipers out of the trees, and driving a friggin tank!  The zombie mode provides a lot of extra fun if you have friends to play with. Being an old game, there are a huge library of custom maps and mods for this game that are very stable and fun on the internet.  Beware though. Despite being a very old release, I still cannot play it in high graphic settings. I need to lower my resolution to lower-than-average to get playable framerates. This game is really poorly optimized.  It would be better if this game had Steam achievements.  My score: 8/10",1,best thing love game full campaign coop play coop friend story campaign start end campaign story quite interesting contains lot different aspect war experience like captured hostage waiting executed using flamethrower burn enemy fortress shooting snipers trees driving friggin tank zombie mode provides lot extra fun friends play old game huge library custom maps mods game stable fun internet beware though despite old release still cannot play high graphic settings need lower resolution lowerthanaverage get playable framerates game really poorly optimized would better game steam achievements score

"Call of Duty: World at War. Damn, this is one of the best Call of Duty games ever made. And I'd know, I've played all the games in the main Series. And I'm no fanboy, because let me say, some of them have sucked. But this one is special. Made by my favorite Call of Duty developers, Treyarch. Call of Duty: World at War was the fifth installment in the series, and in my opinion is better than all of it's predecessors. It featured again another Campaign although this time it was Co-Op. It returned with Online Multiplayer, which featured tanks for the first time, this being the only Call of Duty game ever to include vehicles. But unfortunatly at this time hackers and modders usaully ruin the multiplayer fun, but you might find some good servers. If you buy this game do NOT buy it for the multiplayer, do it for the modded zombies and campaign. And also introduced the community to the gamemode that makes this game still popular today. The Nazi Zombies mode. Don't be alarmed by the Nazi Part. As it is part of the very in depth zombies story-line and this is the game that kicks that story off. All of these gamemodes take place during WWII. The major reason why this game is probably so popular today, is because of the amazing modding community. The most active modding in all Call of Duty games is this one. Once again the modding revolves mostly around the Nazi Zombies mode. Overall in the End I rate Call of Duty: World at War a 9 out of 10.",1,call duty world war damn one best call duty games ever made id know ive played games main series im fanboy let say sucked one special made favorite call duty developers treyarch call duty world war fifth installment series opinion better predecessors featured another campaign although time coop returned online multiplayer featured tanks first time call duty game ever include vehicles unfortunatly time hackers modders usaully ruin multiplayer fun might find good servers buy game buy multiplayer modded zombies campaign also introduced community gamemode makes game still popular today nazi zombies mode dont alarmed nazi part part depth zombies storyline game kicks story gamemodes take place wwii major reason game probably popular today amazing modding community active modding call duty games one modding revolves mostly around nazi zombies mode overall end rate call duty world war

"Ignore that my steam account only has 8.7 hours, I've played much longer than that, trust me.  Anyway... Counter-Strike. This game is awesome. I've seen a lot of reviews that say it's dead, but considering the fact that theres about 8,000 people playing at once each day, I can safely say they are wrong. 1.6 is a true competitive shooter, and this (and CZ because they are basically the same) is my favourite and will be known as the best of its series.  Keep this in mind though; this game is HARD. You can't just hop in and kill everyone. No matter if you're some professional CS:GO global elite, if you haven't played this game before, you WILL suck. Deal with it. This game is a lot different to its other titles (Apart from CZ) and when played feels like an almost different game. It's harder than the others and should stay that way.  Only downside is that nobody plays simple server PUGs anymore, so I may have to sign up to ESEA (not free), but it's probably worth it. Remember this game is harder, if you start on this and get good, then you will be even better on GO.   Trust me, if you play 1.6 then go onto CS:GO, it's a breeze.  BUY THIS GAME AND PLAY IT.",1,ignore steam account hours ive played much longer trust anyway counterstrike game awesome ive seen lot reviews say dead considering fact theres people playing day safely say wrong true competitive shooter cz basically favourite known best series keep mind though game hard cant hop kill everyone matter youre professional csgo global elite havent played game suck deal game lot different titles apart cz played feels like almost different game harder others stay way downside nobody plays simple server pugs anymore may sign esea free probably worth remember game harder start get good even better go trust play go onto csgo breeze buy game play

"I bought this game on Steam to play Custom Zombies in combination with multiplayer... Zombies do work so far I've tested (just Der Riese so far) and than I tried out the multiplayer. That doesn't work, at all. If I launch the multiplayer a black screen appears and I have to reboot my PC because nothing happens, if I run it in safe mode the main menu layout appears but than again, it freezes and there is nothing I can do... And I'm not the only one. On the CoD WaW forum on Steam there are multiple people with the same problem: black screen. So my advice for this moment: Don't buy the game until there is a workaround.",-1,bought game steam play custom zombies combination multiplayer zombies work far ive tested der riese far tried multiplayer doesnt work launch multiplayer black screen appears reboot pc nothing happens run safe mode main menu layout appears freezes nothing im one cod waw forum steam multiple people problem black screen advice moment dont buy game workaround

"Horrible, just horrible. Everyone gives this good reviews based on nostalgia. I saw all the good reviews and thought I should try it out. Upon opening the game, was a cringy menu. I fiddle with the settings, and theres no damn graphics options! I put the crosshair on small.(Definitely not small) So, I go to servers and all the servers have horrible maps. Plus, closest servers had 0 players. I click on a Dust 2 server with 10 players. When it loads up, nobody speaks ♥♥♥♥ing english. The buy menu controls were so ♥♥♥♥ed up I couldnt buy a gun. So, I stuck with the pistol. I go through the middle, and all the players look the same! You cant even tell who's who. Literally, the ♥♥♥♥ing same. So I die instantly because i couldn't even tell it was an enemy. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I finally managed to buy a gun in the ♥♥♥♥ed up menu. I find someone, spray at em', and surprisingly it was enemy. My gun starts shooting in the ♥♥♥♥ing sky, recoil over 9000, and I was burst firing! Absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Another HORRIBLE thing about this game, its graphics and audio! It just doesnt meet todays standards. I think I might have to bleach my eyes after glancing at this game. Its horrible. I only played the game for under 10 minutes and I already want to kill my self. Trust me, save your money. If you loved this game as a kid, I dont care get it. But if youre looking for a good FPS, to TODAYS standards, dont get this garbarge! Save your ten dollars and use it to get your ♥♥♥♥ sucked by the girl down the street. So, simplest way possible.

"Playing the original  (kinda, after the mod-play anyway)  CS game in 2015 has a certain nostalgia factor, bringing back fun  (&amp; sometimes bleh)  memories for those who played and supported it during infancy. 15 years ago, I couldn't have imagined Counter-Strike becoming the competitive FPS-gaming standard that it is today, especially with its latest leap into CS:GO. (Global Offensive, even while taking changes as they come, is the new favorite goose-- Carrying the Law of Newer, Faster, Bolder-- But even there, the core CS spirit &amp; experience is true. And always slowly evolving...)   It's good to look back at how far this franchise has come, as even with each controversial change or update, I know each decision is calculated with the desire to keep moving forward-- While  (hopefully)  staying as true to it's core as possible.   LONG LIVE COUNTER-STRIKE.  &amp; LONG LIVE DIXIE MAFIA.

"This in my opion was Call of Duty's high point. The story was well thought out, the characters were deep, and World War 2 setting was spot on. THe multiplayer was fluid, fair, and rich. All the modding was good, maps, player skins, and much more. But most of all it gave us Nazi Zombies, the wave based survial that started pratically it's own commuinity. World at War will always have a place in my heart and be remember as Call of Duty's best. (Note) I never thought Call of Duty would ever become what it is. Look at Call of Duty 4 and World at War, the best of the best. Black Ops 1 was the only other game I truly loved.

"Counter Strike is an first person shooter that was released in the late 90's.  Whats it about?  Well Counter strike is an online first person shooter where you either play as an terrorist or an counter terrorist.  The terrorists objective is to transport a bomb to a bombsite located on each map marked as (A) or (B). Whilst the counter terrorists main objective is to stop the terrorist force from planting the bomb.  Theres also a gamemode where the terrorists will have hostages and the counter terrorists objective is to rescue the hostages before the time runs out.  Game ends when the counter terrorists has saved all hostages or the terrorists has whiped all counter terrorists.   Is it worth buying?  Since this is an really old game and the graphics are really outdated compared to the games we have today i would still say this game is worth buying.  The game is over 15 years old but still has a alot of active players and playing with friends make it even better.  Counter Strike also has alot of maps, mods and other stuff that makes the game better in any way.  Graphics. 7/10 Sound. 8/10 Gameplay. 10/10  This review is based on my own opinion and noone elses!",1,counter strike first person shooter released late whats well counter strike online first person shooter either play terrorist counter terrorist terrorists objective transport bomb bombsite located map marked b whilst counter terrorists main objective stop terrorist force planting bomb theres also gamemode terrorists hostages counter terrorists objective rescue hostages time runs game ends counter terrorists saved hostages terrorists whiped counter terrorists worth buying since really old game graphics really outdated compared games today would still say game worth buying game years old still alot active players playing friends make even better counter strike also alot maps mods stuff makes game better way graphics sound gameplay review based opinion noone elses

"There are 3 games in the Counter-Strike series. There is Counter-Strike Source. Then you have the middle aged brother out of the group, Counter-Strike Condition Zero. Sure these two updated and improved versions are some what good. But the oldest brother is the best. Counter-Strike 1.6. Thought it is the oldest out of all the three, it seems to me that it's the most played and respected game out of them all. I mean sure the other two may be fun. But there is no match up to what the real game. What I mean by this, Counter-Strike 1.6 is the orignal and by far best Counter-Strike ever made. So basically this game may be old but it is the most played and fun out of the three.   Reason being, Counter-Strike 1.6 has the most active and filled Steam Community. The legit and good players of the Counter-Strike series have stayed with the old school. Even though 1.6 may not have as good as graphics as Condition Zero or Counter-Strike Source. It is the most played and talked about around the gaming world. You dont see big gaming websites talking about Condition Zero events. There are no big major Condition Zero events. All of the good and legit players are basically all playing Counter-Strike 1.6. Sure there is some talk about Counter-Strike Source. But non the less, Counter-Strike 1.6 takes some skill to play and become well known as a top notch player. As in Counter-Strike Source there are many messed up things with aim and registration. So really even the slitest baddies can get somewhere with Counter-Strike Source. For as in Counter-Strike 1.6 there is a good amount of skillz needed to play the gama. Atleast to play good.   Soon I hear that a new Counter-Strike is coming into play. Sort of a combination of all three games. Condition-Zero, Counter-Strike Source put some play into it. But see they do not use anything from Counter-Strike 1.6. Theres another good reason why this game is going to be just like Condition-Zero and Counter-Strike Source. Sure people may play the game for a while when its comes out. But all in all Counter-Strike 1.6 is going to be the best Counter-Strike game in the series. Like stated earlier graphics dont matter to me. As well as they dont matter to real gamers. If you play a game cause of it's graphics, then im really sorry to tell you that you are not a real gamer. Its said but true. Games are never about the graphics. Its what the game is and if people enjoy playing it. Sure graphics are sometimes nice. But Counter-Strike 1.6 does not have the greatest graphics in the world and it is one of the most well known and played games in the whole gaming world.",1,games counterstrike series counterstrike source middle aged brother group counterstrike condition zero sure two updated improved versions good oldest brother best counterstrike thought oldest three seems played respected game mean sure two may fun match real game mean counterstrike orignal far best counterstrike ever made basically game may old played fun three reason counterstrike active filled steam community legit good players counterstrike series stayed old school even though may good graphics condition zero counterstrike source played talked around gaming world dont see big gaming websites talking condition zero events big major condition zero events good legit players basically playing counterstrike sure talk counterstrike source non less counterstrike takes skill play become well known top notch player counterstrike source many messed things aim registration really even slitest baddies get somewhere counterstrike source counterstrike good amount skillz needed play gama atleast play good soon hear new counterstrike coming play sort combination three games conditionzero counterstrike source put play see use anything counterstrike theres another good reason game going like conditionzero counterstrike source sure people may play game comes counterstrike going best counterstrike game series like stated earlier graphics dont matter well dont matter real gamers play game cause graphics im really sorry tell real gamer said true games never graphics game people enjoy playing sure graphics sometimes nice counterstrike greatest graphics world one well known played games whole gaming world

Good old game. It can be used (by servers) as 'sandbox' for creating FirstPersonShooter prototypes (which does not work in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive). It has simple mechanics which you can learn in few seconds and you can keep getting better (for example with bunny hop). There is only one big problem - cheaters. But it can be solved by playing only on VAC secured servers.,1,good old game used servers sandbox creating firstpersonshooter prototypes work counterstrike global offensive simple mechanics learn seconds keep getting better example bunny hop one big problem cheaters solved playing vac secured servers

"Call of Duty: World at War is the fifth game in the COD franchise, releasing in 2008 on PC, PS3, PS2, Wii and Xbox 360. The game was developed by Treyarch and published by Activision. This game is set in the World War II era where you play as various soldiers from United States and The Red Army. Please note that this review is purely based on the single player aspect of World at War.   The gameplay shares several features with the rest of the COD franchise up to this release. You spend the majority of the time with at least one other AI controlled squad member which guide you through levels and keeps you up to date with your current objective. You may only carry two weapons at any one time, whilst also having access to smoke grenades, Molotov’s and hand grenades. We have all of the standard FPS mechanics like crouching and prone positions. You recover health by staying out of line of fire of enemies, since there is no “health” packs throughout the game. You know when you are getting close to death as the edges of your screen glow red and your heartbeat increases. I personally think this is a nice feature rather than relying on a health bar, it adds to the immersion of the gameplay as the UI is very minimal.   Since this game was released almost eight years ago, the graphics are certainly starting to show their age, with some really low res textures, but the environments are all still really nicely designed, animations on everything is stellar too. Character models are all high quality too. The game’s sound effects are brilliant too; you really feel like you are under heavy fire from enemies when you have surround sound on with a sub. The fully voice acted characters are also very well done too.   This is one of the few COD games which I had a few moments of difficulty throughout the campaign. Usually with COD games your AI partners are able to carry you through most levels with little interaction from you needed, however this game is different. The tank missions are the ones I found to be the most difficult as you really need eyes in the back of your head in order to avoid taking damage from the hundreds of enemies that have you in their sights. I am not condemning the game for difficulty; it is really refreshing to see a COD game has the challenge in it. The more recent COD games have become a walk in the park so it was nice to see something different here.   Whilst the game is linear, there are a few collectables to find throughout the single player campaign, there are 13 “death cards” to be found on every level which unlock cheat modes when playing in co-op. This again is a really cool feature and gives you some incentive to check every room, nook and cranny to find the collectables rather than a pointless achievement.   The only negative point about this game for me is the game’s length. I realise I only played the single player so I am only getting half of the experience, but I would have liked to have seen at least five hour single player campaign mode. I managed to complete the game on a medium difficulty in just over three hours. You could replay the game to go back and find all of the collectables and you could also ramp up the difficulty, but given the linearity of the game I don’t see myself jumping into doing that anytime soon. Looking at the Steam chart numbers, the multiplayer scene is really active still so if multiplayer is your jam you will find a match quite easily still.   Technically I only had one issue, and that is with the graphics on some levels. It almost felt like my graphics card was dying as there was spewing graphics all over my screen at some point. It is hard to explain how they looked, but they were really off putting to the game and only happened every few levels. A simple re-load resolved the issue thankfully.   Call of Duty: World at War is one of the best games in the COD franchise and one that still holds its own in the current generation of games. Due to the single player’s length, the price point on this game is quite high at £19,99. I would say that if you plan on getting into the multiplayer side of this game, you should pick it up for that price, however if you are only interested in the single player campaign mode, you would be better off waiting for it to go on sale, unfortunately reduction on COD games are very rare so you need to keep your eyes peeled for the deals!   For anyone who has just skipped a head to my rating; I will repeat, this game was reviewed purely on the single player campaign; please bear that in mind with this rating.      Tom's Score Card   1) Stay away 2) Not Recommended   3) Only recommended when on sale   4) Recommended 5) Highly recommended 6) This is a must play  If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

The riot shield allows you to avoid bullets but you cannot have a primary weapon if you have it equiped so you can only use your sidearm.

"Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter game in which players join either the terrorist team, the counter-terrorist team, or become spectators. Each team attempts to complete their mission objective and/or eliminate the opposing team. Each round starts with the two teams spawning simultaneously.  The objectives vary depending on the type of map, and these are the most usual ones:  Bomb defusal: The terrorists must carry a bomb, plant it on one of the designated spots and protect it from being disarmed by the counter-terrorists before it explodes to win. The counter-terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion. Hostage rescue: The counter-terrorists must rescue a group of hostages held by the terrorists to win. The terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion. VIP escort: One of the counter-terrorists is chosen to act as a VIP and the team must escort this player to a designated spot on the map to win the game. The terrorists win if the VIP is killed or if the time runs out with no conclusion. A player can choose to play as one of eight different default character models (four for each side, although Counter-Strike: Condition Zero added two extra models, bringing the total to ten). Players are generally given a few seconds before the round begins (known as 'freeze time') to prepare and buy equipment, during which they cannot attack or move. They can return to the buy area within a set amount of time to buy more equipment (some custom maps included neutral 'buy zones' that could be used by both teams). Once the round has ended, surviving players retain their equipment for use in the next round; players who were killed begin the next round with the basic default starting equipment.  Standard monetary bonuses are awarded for winning a round, losing a round, killing an enemy, being the first to instruct a hostage to follow, rescuing a hostage, planting the bomb (Terrorist) or defusing the bomb (Counter-Terrorist).  The scoreboard displays team scores in addition to statistics for each player: name, kills, deaths, and ping (in milliseconds). The scoreboard also indicates whether a player is dead, carrying the bomb (on bomb maps), or is the VIP (on assassination maps), although information on players on the opposing team is hidden from a player until his/her death, as this information can be important.  Killed players become 'spectators' for the duration of the round; they cannot change their names before their next spawn, text chat cannot be sent to or received from live players, and voice chat can only be received from live players and not sent to them. Spectators are generally able to watch the rest of the round from multiple selectable views, although some servers disable some of these views to prevent dead players from relaying information about living players to their teammates through alternative media (most notably voice in the case of Internet cafes and Voice over IP programs such as TeamSpeak or Ventrilo). This form of cheating is known as 'ghosting.'",1,counterstrike firstperson shooter game players join either terrorist team counterterrorist team become spectators team attempts complete mission objective andor eliminate opposing team round starts two teams spawning simultaneously objectives vary depending type map usual ones bomb defusal terrorists must carry bomb plant one designated spots protect disarmed counterterrorists explodes win counterterrorists win time runs conclusion hostage rescue counterterrorists must rescue group hostages held terrorists win terrorists win time runs conclusion vip escort one counterterrorists chosen act vip team must escort player designated spot map win game terrorists win vip killed time runs conclusion player choose play one eight different default character models four side although counterstrike condition zero added two extra models bringing total ten players generally given seconds round begins known freeze time prepare buy equipment cannot attack move return buy area within set amount time buy equipment custom maps included neutral buy zones could used teams round ended surviving players retain equipment use next round players killed begin next round basic default starting equipment standard monetary bonuses awarded winning round losing round killing enemy first instruct hostage follow rescuing hostage planting bomb terrorist defusing bomb counterterrorist scoreboard displays team scores addition statistics player name kills deaths ping milliseconds scoreboard also indicates whether player dead carrying bomb bomb maps vip assassination maps although information players opposing team hidden player hisher death information important killed players become spectators duration round cannot change names next spawn text chat cannot sent received live players voice chat received live players sent spectators generally able watch rest round multiple selectable views although servers disable views prevent dead players relaying information living players teammates alternative media notably voice case internet cafes voice ip programs teamspeak ventrilo form cheating known ghosting

"Call of Duty: World at War was the first Call of Duty game I played. It had just been released a bit before I got my hands on it. I had gotten a Wii and a friend let me borrow the title. I was instantly hooked on the shooter and played the Call of Duty series every year it was released. Sadly the Wii version excluded the beloved Nazi Zombies gamemode. Modern Warfare Reflex came out on the Wii, a month after I got MWR it was Christmas and I recieved a PlayStation 3. Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 had just came out the month before. I also proceeded to buying World at War to finally get a taste of the game without using a gun with a remote attached to it.   The game itself is great. To revisit such a devastating time in history really gave me insight of how and why we goto war. The storyline of the game was great, and the multiplayer was fantastic. Zombies is literally the most addicting and fun gamemode I've played. It has so much to offer. Teamwork is key to survivng the levels and progressing. It gets harder and harder to take the zombies down and more keep coming. Treyarch did a great job with this game.",1,call duty world war first call duty game played released bit got hands gotten wii friend let borrow title instantly hooked shooter played call duty series every year released sadly wii version excluded beloved nazi zombies gamemode modern warfare reflex came wii month got mwr christmas recieved playstation call duty modern warfare came month also proceeded buying world war finally get taste game without using gun remote attached game great revisit devastating time history really gave insight goto war storyline game great multiplayer fantastic zombies literally addicting fun gamemode ive played much offer teamwork key survivng levels progressing gets harder harder take zombies keep coming treyarch great job game

Great visuals and an awesome story (in terms of Call of Duty stories that is) Multiplayer is a huge success and brings hours and hours of enjoyment with the usual prestige system they've got going.

I'd give this game a 8/10 I'll just urge you all not to bother buying it anymore as the playerbase is basically nothing.",-1,great game appauling due age lack community hardly even worth review ill refunding instead ill share thoughts console version played years upon release great visuals awesome story terms call duty stories multiplayer huge success brings hours hours enjoyment usual prestige system theyve got going overall one favoured cod experienced id give game ill urge bother buying anymore playerbase basically nothing

"My personal Favorite Call of Duty title. Grenades flying at you constantly on veteran; good times by the way. The modding community has done alot for World at War's multiplayer, like increased xp servers and low gravity servers. There are only 3 different types of killstreak rewards: Recon plane, Artillery, and Dogs. And the dogs in World at War are a 2 hit kill instead of the stupid 1 hit kill in Black ops and so on. but that's what I like about World at War's multiplayer. There's no ridiculous killstreaks like the ones we have in Modern Warfare 3 and so on. I have also encountered zero hackers in World at War's multiplayer.  Zombies: Back when the zombies mode was original and good. Modded maps are awsome. Today, Treyarch bends the zombies story to the point where it is no longer interesting and milking the hell out of their player base with outrageously priced DLC packs! Don't buy them. Not to mention that the zombies mode is now significantly more limited and difficult to the point that it's no longer fun in the Black ops titles. But World at War's zombies are simply the best.  Call of Duty: World at War gets a 9/10. That's gonna do it for this review and I will see you guys on the next one  Let's form up! ~Stealth 1548",1,personal favorite call duty title grenades flying constantly veteran good times way modding community done alot world wars multiplayer like increased xp servers low gravity servers different types killstreak rewards recon plane artillery dogs dogs world war hit kill instead stupid hit kill black ops thats like world wars multiplayer theres ridiculous killstreaks like ones modern warfare also encountered zero hackers world wars multiplayer zombies back zombies mode original good modded maps awsome today treyarch bends zombies story point longer interesting milking hell player base outrageously priced dlc packs dont buy mention zombies mode significantly limited difficult point longer fun black ops titles world wars zombies simply best call duty world war gets thats gonna review see guys next one lets form stealth

"At the time of the release the sole purpose of the game for my friends and I was to get to level 50 on zombies. Years later I bought it on steam and I\'ve played through the campaign once, played co-op a few times at most and spent the rest of my time browsing multiplayer servers.   COD WaW in my opinion was better than any COD that came after it (I didn\'t bother trying the ones after Black Ops 1 so I can\'t tell you anything more there.)  Worth the money if you want an action packed storyline with some gruesome scenes. Especially worth it if you and a friend play co-op together, there are some fun card type powers you can get, I never finished collecting them so there are probably a few gems.   Worth the money if you want a multiplayer shooter with dozens of servers full of dozens of people all over the world. Modded servers and unmodded. It\'s still got half decent graphics but understand it\'s still an older game.   The only issue i\'d say is the zombies. There are never any people looking to play zombies. You might be able to post something in the community hub and get a random to join you but other than that you\'re out of luck.

So i'm bought back to my original question why do so many people,play thos game now, the graphocs look terroble as they would seeing as it was 15 years ago and so on. I would assume becaise it is because of how succesful amd popular the counter strike franchise is. But they mechanics, movement,graphocs and many more wouldn't be good in today's 2015 gaming standards. Do u just play it to try amd revive the good old times or to simply run away from children?",1,year game made years alot terms technological advnaces need look break throughs inventions know im bought back original question many peopleplay thos game graphocs look terroble would seeing years ago would assume becaise succesful amd popular counter strike franchise mechanics movementgraphocs many wouldnt good todays gaming standards u play try amd revive good old times simply run away children

"First at 8 years, since in 2007, A friend comed at my house and installed me a cracked version of Counter - Strike 1.6 . Well I played it like one thousand hours , my friend moved in other country, and when I was playing someone destroyed my CS. I didn't know how to install it again, so i watched on youtube ,I reinstalled it again, That story with the destroy repeats like 2-3 times. I started to be an admin at 10 years, yes 10 years baby, I was doing requests to be an admin and i was telling them i was from 15 to 25 :D Well servers that i was an admin closed , get to the next one , when this closed , to the next one and like that. I always knew that servers close because there is a lot of money to pay to have one. At 12 years i discovered Steam. The first year I did't have any friend on steam because i Haved a ♥♥♥♥ laptop and i was not able to play call of duty 1 on 30 fps. I continued to be an admin on servers. 1 year ago I discovered an server that I love, I have some great owners that are very nice, and some day the owners decided that the admins need to buy Counter-Strike 1.6 . I don't planned to buy Cs 1.6 on steam because i already have it cracked , but i loved the server so much that i buyed it on steam! I think that i have like 5000 hours of play with cracked CS's :)  I totally recommend this game! 11/10  Love CS 1.6! &lt;3",1,first years since friend comed house installed cracked version counter strike well played like one thousand hours friend moved country playing someone destroyed cs didnt know install watched youtube reinstalled story destroy repeats like times started admin years yes years baby requests admin telling well servers admin closed get next one closed next one like always knew servers close lot money pay one years discovered steam first year didt friend steam haved laptop able play call duty fps continued admin servers year ago discovered server love great owners nice day owners decided admins need buy counterstrike dont planned buy cs steam already cracked loved server much buyed steam think like hours play cracked css totally recommend game love cs lt

"The best Call of Duty game during a time when Call of Duty was a decent series. The campaign is amazingly good from a series that is mostly known for its multiplayer experience, the American storyline is presented with a refreshing low amount of nuthugging and the Russian storyline is presented with a refeshingly low amount of 'look at these satanic communists' spiel. I was equally invested in both storylines, the 2 levels covering the storming of the Reichstag were incredible. The cinematic intros are also gorgeous, with some genuinely interesting statistics being presented to you in a visually attention grabbing manner.  Also the gore! What the hell happened? Why is this fantastic gore not present in other CoD games? Im guessing its because of the ever corporate 'keep the ratings low for more sales' but WOW, this gore adds so much visually to combat in the game.  And co-op! Being able to play through my favourite Call of Duty campaign with my buddy is a blast, campaigns that work as singleplayer and co-op without ruining one another are sorely needed more!",1,best call duty game time call duty decent series campaign amazingly good series mostly known multiplayer experience american storyline presented refreshing low amount nuthugging russian storyline presented refeshingly low amount look satanic communists spiel equally invested storylines levels covering storming reichstag incredible cinematic intros also gorgeous genuinely interesting statistics presented visually attention grabbing manner also gore hell happened fantastic gore present cod games im guessing ever corporate keep ratings low sales wow gore adds much visually combat game coop able play favourite call duty campaign buddy blast campaigns work singleplayer coop without ruining one another sorely needed

"As has always been the case with CoD, its multiplayer side is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and rife with cheating, screaming kids and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s on the mic. So for the sake of this review I will focus entirely on the singleplayer aspect of the game. Keep in mind I am writing this from the perspective as someone who enjoys learning about history, and is a big fan of the previous two WW2 CoD games for PC (Call of Duty and Call of Duty 2).  Let's list the pros first.   Much better graphics and more detailed environments than CoD1 and CoD2.    In this one you finally get to fight in the Pacific as the US against the Japanese Empire, which is a new and fresh change from the previous two CoDs which focused entirely on the Allies VS the Nazis.    You are finally able to throw back live grenades to save yourself from death, but this really should've been a default feature of CoD2 anyway. At least they got it right this time.    A decent variety of different mission types and environments. It has much more to offer in terms of gameplay variety than CoD2 did, but still less variety than CoD1 offered.    New types of explosives and special grenades that can be used. Molotovs. Satchel Charges, and throwable Mortar bombs, for example.    Flamethrower weapons that actually burn the environment around you, and can destroy foliage and burn corpses.    Slightly more interactive environments than the previous CoD games.  Sadly those are the only positive things I can say about this game. There are unfortunately a lot more negatives.    Campaign is only 15 or so missions in length, and each mission is also very short in length, taking only 10 minutes or so to complete. On the previous two WW2 CoDs for PC, they both had AT LEAST 23 missions, each of which was decently long and had more historical atmosphere.    Fences, EVERYWHERE. Where the heck are all these warring people getting all these barb-wire and pikestick fences from, how do they have the time to place them all, and why are these fences specifically confining people into very well-defined and convenient areas for the player? CoD2 fixed this problem a lot on the majority of their maps by using minefields instead to kill the player if they tried to leave the map, but unfortunately this game has practically NO use of that mechanic and instead just has tons of fences spammed everywhere.    Game-breaking bugs that make some missions impossible to complete without totally restarting. For example, on the Eviction level, there's a 50% chance that your team leader (the old russian guy, I don't remember what his name was) will get stuck in the motioning-in animation by the grate-door opening to the subway, and you need him with you to complete the mission. All you can do to fix this is to restart the mission and HOPE he doesn't do it again.    Much of the game's atmosphere is just zombie-apocalyptic with death metal music for ambience, probably done by the developers to appeal to your average run-of-the-mill FPS ♥♥♥♥♥♥s who don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about history and just want to shoot stuff.    The mounting feature for deployable weapons (such as the MG42) is practically useless because there are almost no points on any of the maps where you can actually mount it at. You should be able to mount it anywhere you are at, there's no reason not to be able to.    The Russians are depicted as murderous, merciless, brutal monsters, who kill everything in sight, terrorize and torture innocent people, and take no prisoners. In some ways with Communist USSR, this is accurate, but the developers pushed this attitude onto the Russian characters in the game to the point where it's arguably anti-russian propaganda.    Many of the Pacific Campaign maps are poorly designed, with it being impossible to see where you are going without literally walking alongside the map's [s]fluid and convenient fences[/s] walls just to find the path.    The GUI is cartoonish and poorly designed. Instead of a large number counter to show the bullets in your clip, you have a tiny little indicator in the bottom righthand corner of your screen, with the bullets in your clip shown by actual individual icons of bullets, which are so small you can barely even see them. This is something that the previous two WW2 CoDs were much better at in regard.    The main characters in the game are completely flat, boring and static; they have very little about them that's interesting and are just your average generic soldiers with guns. Even in the previous CoDs they managed to make their characters interesting and much more engaging.    Unlike the previous WW2 CoDs which each had about 2 tank levels, this one only has one tank battle level, and it sucks. The tank movement mechanics are unresponsive and poorly designed, and it's extremely easy to get your tank stuck, to where you have no choice but to restart the level. CoD1 did a great job of providing stable tank movement, with the ability to just hold the spacebar to have your tank orientate with the turret. Oh yeah, that reminds me: You can't drive independently with free turret movement. The tank only drives in the direction your turret faces.    The beautiful sound effects for guns that were in CoD2 have all been thrown out in favor of generic, much-quieter bullet sounds. Very disappointing from an aesthetic standpoint.    The melee knifing mechanic is extremely overpowered and oftentimes I have just resorted to flanking my enemies and knifing them all. It's incredibly unrealistic and historically inaccurate, and is one of the most unbalanced and tasteless video game mechanics ever invented.    The sprinting mechanic is likewise overpowered and lets you run super-fast for long distances, with a very short and very invisible recharge time.   All in all this game was clearly just made to appeal to mindless 'MLG 360 Noscope' FPS gamers, with little regard for appropriate treatment of historical atmosphere or character development. I must say I am considerably disappointed in this game, and I can't really recommend it to anyone with an IQ above 90.",-1,always case cod multiplayer side rife cheating screaming kids mic sake review focus entirely singleplayer aspect game keep mind writing perspective someone enjoys learning history big fan previous two ww cod games pc call duty call duty lets list pros first much better graphics detailed environments cod cod one finally get fight pacific us japanese empire new fresh change previous two cods focused entirely allies vs nazis finally able throw back live grenades save death really shouldve default feature cod anyway least got right time decent variety different mission types environments much offer terms gameplay variety cod still less variety cod offered new types explosives special grenades used molotovs satchel charges throwable mortar bombs example flamethrower weapons actually burn environment around destroy foliage burn corpses slightly interactive environments previous cod games sadly positive things say game unfortunately lot negatives campaign missions length mission also short length taking minutes complete previous two ww cods pc least missions decently long historical atmosphere fences everywhere heck warring people getting barbwire pikestick fences time place fences specifically confining people welldefined convenient areas player cod fixed problem lot majority maps using minefields instead kill player tried leave map unfortunately game practically use mechanic instead tons fences spammed everywhere gamebreaking bugs make missions impossible complete without totally restarting example eviction level theres chance team leader old russian guy dont remember name get stuck motioningin animation gratedoor opening subway need complete mission fix restart mission hope doesnt much games atmosphere zombieapocalyptic death metal music ambience probably done developers appeal average runofthemill fps dont give history want shoot stuff mounting feature deployable weapons mg practically useless almost points maps actually mount able mount anywhere theres reason able russians depicted murderous merciless brutal monsters kill everything sight terrorize torture innocent people take prisoners ways communist ussr accurate developers pushed attitude onto russian characters game point arguably antirussian propaganda many pacific campaign maps poorly designed impossible see going without literally walking alongside maps sfluid convenient fencess walls find path gui cartoonish poorly designed instead large number counter show bullets clip tiny little indicator bottom righthand corner screen bullets clip shown actual individual icons bullets small barely even see something previous two ww cods much better regard main characters game completely flat boring static little thats interesting average generic soldiers guns even previous cods managed make characters interesting much engaging unlike previous ww cods tank levels one one tank battle level sucks tank movement mechanics unresponsive poorly designed extremely easy get tank stuck choice restart level cod great job providing stable tank movement ability hold spacebar tank orientate turret oh yeah reminds cant drive independently free turret movement tank drives direction turret faces beautiful sound effects guns cod thrown favor generic muchquieter bullet sounds disappointing aesthetic standpoint melee knifing mechanic extremely overpowered oftentimes resorted flanking enemies knifing incredibly unrealistic historically inaccurate one unbalanced tasteless video game mechanics ever invented sprinting mechanic likewise overpowered lets run superfast long distances short invisible recharge time game clearly made appeal mindless mlg noscope fps gamers little regard appropriate treatment historical atmosphere character development must say considerably disappointed game cant really recommend anyone iq

"Being someone who played CS:GO before this game, I must say I was pleasently suprised. The gameplay was great, and the community was quite helpful and much less toxic. I love Half Life, and this is very similar. Really fun to just do some deathmatch, I find it to be much more enjoyable then CS:GO. The bullets go where you shoot them, and hit reg is not awful. There is a much greater spread of maps here then in GO, and they are all great.

"The classic that set an entire subgenre of FPS games. I played the beta, and played that for YEARS before buying and installing 1.6. That's when I first got my Steam account. Then I got CS:Source. Then, it was others. Thirty games later, I still love the original CS. I was a member of 76th AD on Day of Defeat, and I regularly hung out on Vir's Pub in Vancouver long after the release of CS:S. There's a reason this game has more hours logged than any other for me (over 1400 hours, at last check); it never gets old. I sometimes have to remember to buy ammo, since CS:S tied ammo to the weapon, but this game was truly my first love in the FPS genre.  Seriously, just get it. It's always good to have the classic. And seriously—I only play CS and CS:S in the series; CS:GO's pay-to-win system is not what I look for in a game. Bide your time, build up your funds, and then unleash the fury. It's that simple. No, I'm not good enough to do pro gaming. I'm not even really good enough to make it on the amateur circuit. But I did get good enough to be an even match to my friends… all without paying for deus ex machina.   I don't play WoW for similar reasons: I refuse to pay a monthly fee to play a game. Yes, there are free (libre) servers out there. My stepson runs one. But the point is that if I buy the license to the game, I should be able to play all I want without having to pay a fee. Pay-to-win is arguably worse than pay-to-play; it creates an unbalanced play experience, and I refuse to participate in that.   Bearing that in mind, that's why I love CS and CS:S. It's just you, your skill, and an adversarial challenge. There's no buying your way to victory. I hope Valve can get back to that in future releases.",1,classic set entire subgenre fps games played beta played years buying installing thats first got steam account got cssource others thirty games later still love original cs member th ad day defeat regularly hung virs pub vancouver long release css theres reason game hours logged hours last check never gets old sometimes remember buy ammo since css tied ammo weapon game truly first love fps genre seriously get always good classic seriouslyi play cs css series csgos paytowin system look game bide time build funds unleash fury simple im good enough pro gaming im even really good enough make amateur circuit get good enough even match friends without paying deus ex machina dont play wow similar reasons refuse pay monthly fee play game yes free libre servers stepson runs one point buy license game able play want without pay fee paytowin arguably worse paytoplay creates unbalanced play experience refuse participate bearing mind thats love cs css skill adversarial challenge theres buying way victory hope valve get back future releases

" Introduction:  Call of Duty World at War developed by Treyarch is now a beloved classic in the eye's of many Call of Duty enthusiasts and still incredibly sought after by PC gamers to this day.    Overview:  Developed by Treyarch Call of Duty World at War remains amongst the top of many PC Call of Duty fans wishlists and standard playlists years after release for many reasons. True to the series fluid arcade style FPS gameplay elements fueled by adrenaline and a constant gameplay flow. Call of Duty: World at War separates itself from the pack as the last true Call of Duty PC release.   With graphics optimization unheard of in this day and age of COD console ports to a modding friendly PC release, whether it be it's first forray in into Treyarchs now trademark Zombie mode or a multitude of community driven content in all aspects of multiplayer. Call of Duty: World at War is seen as the last title in the series to be given the full PC treatment gamers grew used to and has sadly never returned.   Fans of the series who have never experienced Call of Duty: World at War will be amazed at the amount of content available as a standard retail release. The PC Steam version of this title comes preloaded with the DLC preinstalled for $19.99 which, is why this title has never seen a price drop aside from activisions penchant for never letting their financial steely grip on price reductions slip through their fingers and benefit the consumer on the backend. I must reiterate this Call of Duty release simply doesn't need one. With all the content available in this iteration anyone considering a purchase will be more than pleased with their decision to opt in to the lesser known older brother of the Black Ops series.   Graphics:  8.5  Just as any other version of the generation 7 Call of Duty games this is also based on the 2007 Unreal engine which, means considering the amount of graphics optimization available Call of Duty: World at War in comparison to it's younger siblings still holds it's own in many aspects and more in some cases.    Gameplay:  8.0  Although not quite as intricate as Infinity Wards fan favorite Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. World at War holds it's own where it matters.....Solid gameplay. This is a tried and true Call of Duty recipe since the originals release which I am happy to say is represented perfectly. Although a bit on the no frills side in comparison to Modern Warfare, some prefer it's tenacious gun battles and old school FPS precision beats killstreak style and should in the least be embraced by all 'New school' Call of Duty fans.    Sound:  8.5   A series staple. Call of Duty doesn't let down even by current generation 8 standards. Every whizzing bullet and explosion will test even the most high end of Dolby Surroud Sound systems subwoofers currently on the market today. When the settings are placed just right, you can close your eyes and imagine what an existance in this chaotic time in history would have been like. This truley helps set the tone in any true battlefield experience and World at War doesn't dissapoint.    Online experience:  9.0  After all these years Call of Duty: World at War still has a thriving online vs. multiplayer community supplimented by a vast zombies experience that many consider to be superior to the franchises later releases. Due solely to the dedicated modding community that activision has sadly all but forgotten about in it's later releases. With that being said the multiplayer servers are also maintained by groups of dedicated FPS communities. One specific group that must be mentioned for it's servers integrity and organization is the [PDE] ' PerfectDarkElite', this groups primary servers are maintained by some of the most friendly and integrity driven individuals that I can proudly say I have played along side for countless hours of intense online battles.    Story:  7.5  The story of Call of Duty: World at War is what I would consider it's weakest point. Seeded in the standard World War II scenario, you won't find much originality here. Yet with that being said it still manages to keep your interest as any Call of Duty action fest should with the series standard over exaggerated explosions and barely made it through situations, World at War still has it moments of surprize and awe.    Replay Value:  10  With all the above mentioned features preinstalled in the retail release and available from the online community this is where Call of Duty: World at War shines above the rest!!! If your looking to make a Call of Duty purchase that will last into future if the past is any example then World at War is it! With a lower price tag than it's younger brothers, every dollar is a dollar well spent. The replay value of this title is endless.     Final Review Score:  8.0  There are two defining Call of Duty titles from the seventh generation that not only set the standard for all titles to come in the series but, also simply couldn't be matched in terms of gripping single player campaigns to this day Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and World at War. Without a doubt Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is the superior of the two but, regardless there's a reason that Treyarch continued to base multiple entries on the gameplay formula represented here....Simply put because it's good and they knew it. If you are looking for one of the best World War II campaigns in gaming history and an online experience that still bustles today, then look no farther.",1,introduction call duty world war developed treyarch beloved classic eyes many call duty enthusiasts still incredibly sought pc gamers day overview developed treyarch call duty world war remains amongst top many pc call duty fans wishlists standard playlists years release many reasons true series fluid arcade style fps gameplay elements fueled adrenaline constant gameplay flow call duty world war separates pack last true call duty pc release graphics optimization unheard day age cod console ports modding friendly pc release whether first forray treyarchs trademark zombie mode multitude community driven content aspects multiplayer call duty world war seen last title series given full pc treatment gamers grew used sadly never returned fans series never experienced call duty world war amazed amount content available standard retail release pc steam version title comes preloaded dlc preinstalled title never seen price drop aside activisions penchant never letting financial steely grip price reductions slip fingers benefit consumer backend must reiterate call duty release simply doesnt need one content available iteration anyone considering purchase pleased decision opt lesser known older brother black ops series graphics version generation call duty games also based unreal engine means considering amount graphics optimization available call duty world war comparison younger siblings still holds many aspects cases gameplay although quite intricate infinity wards fan favorite call duty modern warfare world war holds matterssolid gameplay tried true call duty recipe since originals release happy say represented perfectly although bit frills side comparison modern warfare prefer tenacious gun battles old school fps precision beats killstreak style least embraced new school call duty fans sound series staple call duty doesnt let even current generation standards every whizzing bullet explosion test even high end dolby surroud sound systems subwoofers currently market today settings placed right close eyes imagine existance chaotic time history would like truley helps set tone true battlefield experience world war doesnt dissapoint online experience years call duty world war still thriving online vs multiplayer community supplimented vast zombies experience many consider superior franchises later releases due solely dedicated modding community activision sadly forgotten later releases said multiplayer servers also maintained groups dedicated fps communities one specific group must mentioned servers integrity organization pde perfectdarkelite groups primary servers maintained friendly integrity driven individuals proudly say played along side countless hours intense online battles story story call duty world war would consider weakest point seeded standard world war ii scenario wont find much originality yet said still manages keep interest call duty action fest series standard exaggerated explosions barely made situations world war still moments surprize awe replay value mentioned features preinstalled retail release available online community call duty world war shines rest looking make call duty purchase last future past example world war lower price tag younger brothers every dollar dollar well spent replay value title endless final review score two defining call duty titles seventh generation set standard titles come series also simply couldnt matched terms gripping single player campaigns day call duty modern warfare world war without doubt call duty modern warfare superior two regardless theres reason treyarch continued base multiple entries gameplay formula represented heresimply put good knew looking one best world war ii campaigns gaming history online experience still bustles today look farther

"Hmm... where to begin with this amazing game. This game is the best Call of Duty game there is, in my opinion this game even tops COD4. Let me explain why, the campaign is so much fun, Intresting and replayable because this campaign has so many great missions. Next the Multiplayer... To date the Multiplayer is amazing but nowadays there are a few Hackers who just ruin it, but its very little that I see them in a game and there are some Higher XP lobbies which will get you ranked up quickly if you are new to the game so you can get the good guns such as the MP-40, Thompson and My fav weapon in the game the Springfield plus the MP maps are just amazing and have been remade becuase they where just to great. And then there is zombies a gamemode that was nearly canceled (which would have been a massive mistake) the zombies maps are my favs out of the Treyarch games and are the most fun to play and with people making modded zombie maps the fun can keep going. But zombies is very very fun if you have not played a Cod Treyarch game then I reccomend this one first to see how amazing cod really was. Thanks for reading :)",1,hmm begin amazing game game best call duty game opinion game even tops cod let explain campaign much fun intresting replayable campaign many great missions next multiplayer date multiplayer amazing nowadays hackers ruin little see game higher xp lobbies get ranked quickly new game get good guns mp thompson fav weapon game springfield plus mp maps amazing remade becuase great zombies gamemode nearly canceled would massive mistake zombies maps favs treyarch games fun play people making modded zombie maps fun keep going zombies fun played cod treyarch game reccomend one first see amazing cod really thanks reading

"Counter-Strike is a tactical first-person shooter video game which originated from a Half-Life modification and features real-world weapons.  Counter-Strike pits a team of counter-terrorists against a team of terrorists in a series of rounds. Each round is won by either completing the mission objective or eliminating the opposing force. The game has both individual and multiplayer options. Bots can be added into the game. The online-multiplayer option is activated via Steam.  Other than similarities in basic gameplay, Counter-Strike is not in any way related to Half-Life.

"This insightful and damning critique of the military-industrial complex deserves to be highlighted for its trenchant social commentary as much as for its streamlined, highly polished gameplay. This is a multiplayer shooter with two teams, 'terrorists' and 'counter-terrorists,' but tellingly the player shuffles between the two with ease and there are basically no differences between being on one side or the other, save for their objective, which is often to plant a bomb on nothing of value or rescue 'hostages' who disappear immediately when rescued, as if they were created solely to sustain the conflict. Both teams purchase their weapons from the same supplier with money they earn from fighting each other: endless soldiers fighting an eternal war driven not by ideology but by the military industrial complex, where fighting simply leads to more money and more fighting rather than an eventual peaceful resolution. The graphics could use some work. 8/10!",1,insightful damning critique militaryindustrial complex deserves highlighted trenchant social commentary much streamlined highly polished gameplay multiplayer shooter two teams terrorists counterterrorists tellingly player shuffles two ease basically differences one side save objective often plant bomb nothing value rescue hostages disappear immediately rescued created solely sustain conflict teams purchase weapons supplier money earn fighting endless soldiers fighting eternal war driven ideology military industrial complex fighting simply leads money fighting rather eventual peaceful resolution graphics could use work

"(I've deleted all the comments on this because I wanted to give a serious review about this game and delete my older one, so here ya go)  This is the older Counter-Strike as most people know it. Some people usually don't find enjoyment in playing it due to it being either 'out-dated' or 'glitchy'. I personally tend to enjoy this game from time to time because it's an original game made from the first Source engine, and old school shooters in general ain't too shabby either. Due to the game having a small amount of space to fill in your computer, it rarely ever lags, which makes sure of no interruptions to your enjoyment. It's also just as Competitive as the present Counter-Strike games, though there isn't any seperate Comp gamemode, unfortunately. But that's something that Valve decided to save for later purposes I suppose. Still the King of FPS Games (IMO), I would definetely recommend playing this if you enjoy tactical teamwork in your Online Gaming.",1,ive deleted comments wanted give serious review game delete older one ya go older counterstrike people know people usually dont find enjoyment playing due either outdated glitchy personally tend enjoy game time time original game made first source engine old school shooters general aint shabby either due game small amount space fill computer rarely ever lags makes sure interruptions enjoyment also competitive present counterstrike games though isnt seperate comp gamemode unfortunately thats something valve decided save later purposes suppose still king fps games imo would definetely recommend playing enjoy tactical teamwork online gaming

Honestly this game has aged quited a bit in most aspects. I can't tell you to play the campaign because it's completely linear and it'd be a waste of time. The multiplayer is bad now becasue noone really plays it and the only servers you can get on for the most part have bots.   But god damn the zombies is still good. If you're a zombies fan or a survival fan or whatever this game is a must. The zombies mode in this game is the only reason to own world at war now. Not to mention its really easy to mod this game and get new maps for nazi zombies.

"Decided to try it out to see how far along the CS series has come along and well it came from a rough beginning (based off of my experience). I couldn't find a lobby that wasn't full except for one lobby with only a single guy playing with bots in a TDM game. Now this guy was either really good at CS or hacking but i've never gone 15+ deaths 0 kills by the same guy. Another interesting thing to note is how the maps are vastly different from their counterparts in CSGO which isn't a bad thing just interesting. Secondly, there is a lot less spread in the guns than there is in CSGO a long with a different types of weapons...well for most the only difference was the name of the gun. Also there were more options for CT and T teams.

"This game is great.  I am not a fan of the Call of Duty games, but this World at War is different somehow. I think I love it because enemys will die in 1-4 shots rather than 1 shot - 3 mags like in the newer games.  This game had an increadable American Campaign with the trench warfare against the Japanese and mind blowing Russian Campaign when you are storming the Nazis in their cities. Zombies is increadable and different from Black Ops 1 and 2 zombies. Instead of sitting in your corner with your assualt rifle or light machine gun like in COD: Black Ops 1 and 2, you are constantly moving and buying new weapons as you run out of ammo in World at War's Nazi Zombies.  If I had to talk about any problems I had with the game it would be in some of the missions when you die you go back to a checkpoint (Each checkpoint is at the beggining of an objective or half way through) and some of the objectives last for around 10 to 20 minutes. This means you have to play for another 5 or 10 minutes to get to where you just were, instead of the smaller objectives where you go back 1 or 2 minutes.  But, overal it's a good game. I don't plan to play Multiplayer any time soon because I am told by friends that everybody is hacking.",1,game great fan call duty games world war different somehow think love enemys die shots rather shot mags like newer games game increadable american campaign trench warfare japanese mind blowing russian campaign storming nazis cities zombies increadable different black ops zombies instead sitting corner assualt rifle light machine gun like cod black ops constantly moving buying new weapons run ammo world wars nazi zombies talk problems game would missions die go back checkpoint checkpoint beggining objective half way objectives last around minutes means play another minutes get instead smaller objectives go back minutes overal good game dont plan play multiplayer time soon told friends everybody hacking

Been playing CS since 2003. Despite what the box on tactical ops says no really it's not better than counter strike. CS is the best first person shooter in my opinion.

In order to be a great player you need to know how to execute movement even bunny hop.

"Unlike most Call of Duties and other first person shooters, World at War truly shows what war looks like. If someone is hit by a powerful enough weapon (Such as a machinegun or a high-calibre sniper rifle), a limb or even their head could come off. People are also burned alive by molotovs and flamethrowers. For the hardcore war gamers who don't mind seeing a bit of gore, this is a realistic improvement. For the gamers who don't want to see this, luckily there is a filter you can change in the options, which will cancel out the limb loss &amp; decapitation, it will also scale down the blood a little.  Even without the gore, I still think this game can show you a good glimpse of what war is truly like; Desperate banzai charges, frightening swamp ambushes, deadly tree snipers and brutal machinegun nests are all throughout this dark game. There are two campaigns that neatly show two perspectives of the war: In the American campaign, you are Private Miller in the US Marines, and you fight the brutal Imperial Japanese who will use whatever horrible tactics are available to kill you and your friends. Even if you surrender, they will still execute you. As the American campaign progresses, the atmosphere and morale of the soldiers goes down very badly.  In the Russian campaign, you are Private Petrenko, a conscript in the Red Army, and you fight Nazi Germany's evil Wehrmacht. Instead of a war of struggle, the Russian campaign is more a war of revenge, as you and the raging Red Army soldiers mercilessly and brutally slaughter the German forces, avenging the atrocities the Wehrmacht committed in their Motherland. But you can either choose to show mercy to the Germans, or kill them in however way you wish, but be warned: That doesn't mean your comrades won't kill them, and they usually do.  In my personal opinion, I believe these two epic campaigns are equally as good.  Obviously, no first person shooter or Call of Duty is realistic when it comes to combat, however I don't know how Treyarch did it, but they captured the emotional experience of a war nearly perfectly. I wouldn't be surprised if they had someone in who'd been through war. They got it nearly perfectly: The anger, vengefulness, the fear, terror, everything. How soldiers miss home and reflect on those good old memories before that awful, unfair and terrible thing happened.  All of these things are stuff you'd go through if you were in a war. On a semi-related note, I'd just like to say that I hope, that one day, all war ends, and no one has to go through such an evil, horrible, dark and terrifying experience, ever again. Let games like this remind people why war is a bad thing, because it's not all glory, shooting and fun, trust me.",1,unlike call duties first person shooters world war truly shows war looks like someone hit powerful enough weapon machinegun highcalibre sniper rifle limb even head could come people also burned alive molotovs flamethrowers hardcore war gamers dont mind seeing bit gore realistic improvement gamers dont want see luckily filter change options cancel limb loss amp decapitation also scale blood little even without gore still think game show good glimpse war truly like desperate banzai charges frightening swamp ambushes deadly tree snipers brutal machinegun nests throughout dark game two campaigns neatly show two perspectives war american campaign private miller us marines fight brutal imperial japanese use whatever horrible tactics available kill friends even surrender still execute american campaign progresses atmosphere morale soldiers goes badly russian campaign private petrenko conscript red army fight nazi germanys evil wehrmacht instead war struggle russian campaign war revenge raging red army soldiers mercilessly brutally slaughter german forces avenging atrocities wehrmacht committed motherland either choose show mercy germans kill however way wish warned doesnt mean comrades wont kill usually personal opinion believe two epic campaigns equally good obviously first person shooter call duty realistic comes combat however dont know treyarch captured emotional experience war nearly perfectly wouldnt surprised someone whod war got nearly perfectly anger vengefulness fear terror everything soldiers miss home reflect good old memories awful unfair terrible thing happened things stuff youd go war semirelated note id like say hope one day war ends one go evil horrible dark terrifying experience ever let games like remind people war bad thing glory shooting fun trust

"Call of duty world at war is a throwback to the world war two setting.   The campaign:  In the campaign you play as an American soldier in the pacific and a Russian soldier on the eastern front and eventually berlin.  The campaign is basically your typical modern shooter but world war two themed so expect extremely linear gameplay, lots of set pieces and scripted events, regenerating health, two weapon limit, very stupid AI, lots of hand holding and characters you couldn’t give a ♥♥♥♥ about. World at war does do a few things to separate it from the other call of duty games that being, the tone is much darker and grittier than all of the other games combined, it’s much more violent than before and still the most violent in the series, overall the campaign is somewhat enjoyable but isn’t really that good, and pales in comparison to other ww2 games such as the brothers in arms games, the early medal of honor games, the Wolfenstein games etc.   CO-OP:  The co-op is just the single player campaign but playing with someone else with you on your side, it’s somewhat enjoyable but still not that good.   Zombie mode:   The zombie mode is where you or in co-op are in a level where you’ll have to fight against increasingly large hordes of Nazi or Japanese zombies, you buy weapons from walls and from the mystery box (which will give you a random weapon), you also collect perks from vending machines which consists of quick reloading, double fire rate, quick revive which just lets you take more damage, and juggernog which lets you take more damage. This is one of the most enjoyable parts of this game and it’s nearly always fun to play.   The multiplayer:   The multiplayer is basically the same as the multiplayer in call of duty 4: perks, “classes”, killing spree awards, attachments, instant kill knife etc… What they did do that was different was on some maps they added in tanks for you to drive, and they added the war game mode back from call of duty 3, and the sniping is made so you have breathe control. The multiplayer is fun but it does get old after a while especially since most people only play team death match.   Problems:   Extreme linearity in the single player  The AI is very stupid  Artificial difficulty where if you stay in cover you’ll have 5 grenades lobbed at you.  All of the weapons sound pathetically weak which is quite strange to have weapons that sound like cap guns and bb guns which can blow people’s arms and legs off.   Most people only really ever play team death match rather than the other games modes.   Punkbuster is no longer available for this game so you can’t play on half of the servers.  This is quite a good game to play and is very enjoyable to play only for the zombies and the multiplayer but after a while this will get a bit old thanks to that people only really play team death match, and that these games keep getting made each year and they are all the same really.",1,call duty world war throwback world war two setting campaign campaign play american soldier pacific russian soldier eastern front eventually berlin campaign basically typical modern shooter world war two themed expect extremely linear gameplay lots set pieces scripted events regenerating health two weapon limit stupid ai lots hand holding characters couldnt give world war things separate call duty games tone much darker grittier games combined much violent still violent series overall campaign somewhat enjoyable isnt really good pales comparison ww games brothers arms games early medal honor games wolfenstein games etc coop coop single player campaign playing someone else side somewhat enjoyable still good zombie mode zombie mode coop level youll fight increasingly large hordes nazi japanese zombies buy weapons walls mystery box give random weapon also collect perks vending machines consists quick reloading double fire rate quick revive lets take damage juggernog lets take damage one enjoyable parts game nearly always fun play multiplayer multiplayer basically multiplayer call duty perks classes killing spree awards attachments instant kill knife etc different maps added tanks drive added war game mode back call duty sniping made breathe control multiplayer fun get old especially since people play team death match problems extreme linearity single player ai stupid artificial difficulty stay cover youll grenades lobbed weapons sound pathetically weak quite strange weapons sound like cap guns bb guns blow peoples arms legs people really ever play team death match rather games modes punkbuster longer available game cant play half servers quite good game play enjoyable play zombies multiplayer get bit old thanks people really play team death match games keep getting made year really

"'WaW' was released way back in the year 2008 and is the last to date WWII Call of Duty game to be released, which came out after the first Modern Warfare game. Taking control of two seperate characters you fight through some of the most brutal battles of the war, including crawling through the ember lit blood soaked streets of Stalingrad after the Battle of Stalingrad sniping Nazis, cause ♥♥♥♥ Nazis, or lighting Tohos up with a flamethrower in Okinawa.   This game may be my most favourite of all the CoD games, mainly because of the shear seriousness of the title. Unlike some of the previous and later games this one lacks black humour and tends to stick close to 'The Horrors of War.' They use this to their advantage by showing intense scenes of gore varying from skin melting off of screaming pleading men to watching the brave soilder in front of you lose his frontal lobe all over your boots or even going as far as witnessing mangled bodies spew bloody limbs in opposite directions from an explosion you caused. This all really helps set the tone of the game and allows a deep immersion into the mind of a man surrounded by death and war.   Although this game has the long running theme of vengeance and prejudice it managed to spawn one of the most addiciting mini-games by accident ever spawned by a mortal man. Nazi Zombies. Where, initially, you play as unnamed soilders and later four distinct characters battling undead waves of German, cause ♥♥♥♥ Nazis, und Japanese troops of Zombos.   The game is very enjoyable and through a very fast and simple point and click copy/paste you have access to a Controller support which tickles the console gamer inside of me. (CONSOLE: exec default_controller.cfg) The only downside is like most CoD titles it can be rather expensive, I believe I picked this up for $30 awhile back, may be cheaper now. Luckily unlike the rest of their greedy money hungry titles this one comes with all the map packs and still has a healthy stream of Mulitplayer. It's worthy picking up and if you do I will play the ♥♥♥♥ balls out of Zed with you.",1,waw released way back year last date wwii call duty game released came first modern warfare game taking control two seperate characters fight brutal battles war including crawling ember lit blood soaked streets stalingrad battle stalingrad sniping nazis cause nazis lighting tohos flamethrower okinawa game may favourite cod games mainly shear seriousness title unlike previous later games one lacks black humour tends stick close horrors war use advantage showing intense scenes gore varying skin melting screaming pleading men watching brave soilder front lose frontal lobe boots even going far witnessing mangled bodies spew bloody limbs opposite directions explosion caused really helps set tone game allows deep immersion mind man surrounded death war although game long running theme vengeance prejudice managed spawn one addiciting minigames accident ever spawned mortal man nazi zombies initially play unnamed soilders later four distinct characters battling undead waves german cause nazis und japanese troops zombos game enjoyable fast simple point click copypaste access controller support tickles console gamer inside console exec defaultcontrollercfg downside like cod titles rather expensive believe picked awhile back may cheaper luckily unlike rest greedy money hungry titles one comes map packs still healthy stream mulitplayer worthy picking play balls zed

"This game is probably one of the best first person shooters that you can get. While anymore it may be hard to find a game on multiplayer that is full of people instread of bots, the campaign and zombies mode more than make up for it.  The campaign, while pretty simple, is still a very much enjoyable experience. You play as either an American or Russian soldier (depending on the mission you're on), and you pretty much just work with your squad to get through this war. This isn't like most of the other games in the series to where you are the sole arbiter who just determines the fate of everything, you're just a simple soldier who has answered the call of duty (see what I did there?) for your country.  The zombies mode is a lot more simple than the newer games' zombies mode. Instead of having these huge and convoluted maps with all of these different things to do, you've got a somewhat smaller map, and one goal: Survive. You don't have these massive maps that have all of these different tools, and a giant easter egg for you to solve. Instead, you've got only a couple things; You, your gun, and and endless swarm of flesh eating zombies. Because of this, it makes for a much more enjoyable experience if you want to just sit back and not have to do much to get the full experience. Also, custom zombies also exists for even more maps than the 3 DLC packs provide (which are also given for free, that's a plus).  Overall I'd say this game is well worth the price for it.  (Yes, I know I don't have much play time on here, I've had this game on a different platform before this).",1,game probably one best first person shooters get anymore may hard find game multiplayer full people instread bots campaign zombies mode make campaign pretty simple still much enjoyable experience play either american russian soldier depending mission youre pretty much work squad get war isnt like games series sole arbiter determines fate everything youre simple soldier answered call duty see country zombies mode lot simple newer games zombies mode instead huge convoluted maps different things youve got somewhat smaller map one goal survive dont massive maps different tools giant easter egg solve instead youve got couple things gun endless swarm flesh eating zombies makes much enjoyable experience want sit back much get full experience also custom zombies also exists even maps dlc packs provide also given free thats plus overall id say game well worth price yes know dont much play time ive game different platform

"Call of Duty: World of War. Where to begin with this game? Oh yeah! It's absolutely fantastic. I love this game like no other FPS (except for the now, in my opinion, defunct Team Fortress 2 and my thriving love for Counter-Strike: GO and Overwatch) has dared to rival. Why?  -Graphics- Damn, that ♥♥♥♥ is beautimus. Like, seriously, if you put this in front of me, said 'Oh, this is a game from last year that didn't really reach popularity,' and I didn't know this game like the back of my hand, I would beg you for the prototype of said game. Graphics don't mean everything, though. Which leads me on..  -Gameplay- CoD:WaW revamps the elements from the ever-loved, ever popular CoD4: Modern Warfare (including the engine) and works on them in it's basement like a mad f*cking scientist for a lot of time, slaps that ♥♥♥♥ down in front of you, and lets you experience, in my opinion, one of, if not the best CoD formula to date, closely rivalling/rivalled by Black Ops II and Modern Warfare 2.   -Audio- Yes, I had to include this. No, this is not pointless. See, the voice acting in this game was strategically intended to be realistic. How? They got the voice actors to act as if they were shouting the lines over gunfire. An ingenious move which has seemingly been never utilised since, which is a shame. In addition, everything sounds so incredibly crisp and flowing.  -Campaign- This campaign is one of the best in Call of Duty to date; while incredibly short, it is fast-paced, chaotic, fun and scarily educational. Like, high-level accuracy. Except for the education part, this prepares you perfectly for the multiplayer. Wait, scratch that, you may be educated on which 10 year olds had intercourse with your mother and has the most salt.  -Community-  The community for this game is still large, and unlike console peasants, we don't have to deal with squeakers. Why? Because PC is complex and is allegedly for smarty-smarts. Doesn't stop you from running into about 12,000 Harambes in a match of CS:GO Comp, though. Unlike CS:GO as well, it's community is thriving together as one, as they don't bicker about rank, they collab on projects. Which leads me onto yet another point..  -Custom Content- Oh boy, the big one. Probably the reason why most of you have considered purchasing this beauty of a game. There's great custom content constantly being pumped out by the community regularly, and you can donate to that, or be like me and just play them with your friends and laugh your stupid asses off.   -Overall- Call of Duty: World at War is a great game; though it may be old(er), it is better than Exo Bunny Dab Simulator 2017, otherwise known as Black Ops III for over twice the price tag (for all content). You can never beat the authenticity, fun and sheer greatness of this game.  I rate this game a solid 5/5. F*ck yes, I recommend this game.  SIDE NOTE: I apologise in advance for any spelling/gramatical errors. I am writing this review whilst under the effects of insomnia. That's why you don't play this game, kids.

The 1st cod i ever played set in my favourite time period for a shooter. Made in a time before when actual time and effort was put into the francise. The graphics were pretty good for its time and I think still hold out today. Nothing is more satifying than exploding off your enemies' limbs and watching the gore splatter all around. The campaign is fun and I highly reccommend that players take the time to play it to get the most out of the experience. Its my favourite game in the franchise and none have topped it thus far.,1,st cod ever played set favourite time period shooter made time actual time effort put francise graphics pretty good time think still hold today nothing satifying exploding enemies limbs watching gore splatter around campaign fun highly reccommend players take time play get experience favourite game franchise none topped thus far

"Hello potential buyers, this game is most exquisite. While the more graphically engaging games of today are definite eye candy, the roots of Call of Duty are never more exemplified than in this game. It is the quintessense of everything that Call of Duty had stood for. The campaign is both pleasing to behold, and still challenges the player to use cover. There is no 'super' jump, or invisibility. The multiplayer too, is one of a kind, much like myself. The players work together or fight each other, according to whatever mode they are playing. There are no thirteen year old ♥♥♥♥♥♥s that whine about how other people play, or try to be foolishly offense with 'yo mama' jokes, or outright vulgarity. Such behavior is not tolerated on most servers, and it is a fine thing to witness. This game in my opinion, is the most lavish game of the series. With its reality like physics, and non hostile multiplayer, I don't see why it should not be bought by people who enjoy gaming for the gaming, not the ragefests that pepper the pathetic games of today.

"Counter-Strike is one of the only games that I find myself eventually returning to, no matter what other FPS games are out there.   Replayability holds up over the years with the simple concept of tossing players into two teams and giving them an objective:  (as terrorists)  - planting bombs and defending them until it detonates - holding/defending hostages from the CT  (as Counter-Terrorists)  - preventing bombs being planted or defusing them - rescuing hostages  Graphics aren't much to write home about these days, but it's all about the gameplay and weapon behavior. And, definitely, community. Nostalgia may be a large factors for most of us old timers who've been playing for almost two decades. I've made some great friends through this game, almost destroyed my former marriage from my CS addiction xD, and lost track of so much time while playing. (The hours it says I've played isn't even 1/4 of the time I've spent on this game, lol. Which I'm kind of glad it doesn't say how many months I've probably played on this)",1,counterstrike one games find eventually returning matter fps games replayability holds years simple concept tossing players two teams giving objective terrorists planting bombs defending detonates holdingdefending hostages ct counterterrorists preventing bombs planted defusing rescuing hostages graphics arent much write home days gameplay weapon behavior definitely community nostalgia may large factors us old timers whove playing almost two decades ive made great friends game almost destroyed former marriage cs addiction xd lost track much time playing hours says ive played isnt even time ive spent game lol im kind glad doesnt say many months ive probably played
"I would have to say that this is one of the best games in the Call Of Duty franchise. I got this game on console a few years back and I've had it on PC for a few years as well.  The Campaign is very fun and worth playing. It take about 6-7 hours to complete, but has some intense and epic moments, along with an amazing ending.  The Multiplayer is still very active. I don't play it much but there are many servers out there, most having friendly communitites. It is mainly TDM servers however, so there is a lack of variety. There are a good amount of high XP servers which you can play to rank up quickly, in order to get more weapon choices, perks and equipment.  Zombies is the primary reason myself and many others bought this game. WAW on PC comes with all DLC free of charge, unlike the console version where you need to pay for DLC. The zombies maps that are avaiable are great fun to play on your own, but playing with friends makes the experience far better. The Zombies experience does not end there though. You can download community created maps online and play them aswell. There are literally thousands of maps to choose from. If you wanted to, you could create your own using tools like Radient and upload them to websites dedicated to providing downloads to zombies maps.  Overall, this game is fantastic. I would get it on sale if I were you however. This game is 8 years old now and should be worth less than £20. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to get into COD or wants to go back to boots on the ground gameplay.",1,would say one best games call duty franchise got game console years back ive pc years well campaign fun worth playing take hours complete intense epic moments along amazing ending multiplayer still active dont play much many servers friendly communitites mainly tdm servers however lack variety good amount high xp servers play rank quickly order get weapon choices perks equipment zombies primary reason many others bought game waw pc comes dlc free charge unlike console version need pay dlc zombies maps avaiable great fun play playing friends makes experience far better zombies experience end though download community created maps online play aswell literally thousands maps choose wanted could create using tools like radient upload websites dedicated providing downloads zombies maps overall game fantastic would get sale however game years old worth less would highly recommend game anyone wants get cod wants go back boots ground gameplay

"Let me tell you why this is the best Call of Duty game on PC and why you should most definetely buy it.  For the $20 the game's price is set at, you can get all of the worth that you could possibly want out of a game by playing the zombies mode. Don't like zombies? Check out some servers online hosted by others online so you don't run into hackers/cheaters. Now obviously most people aren't going to buy this game for the multiplayer aspect, and I don't blame them for this seeing that zombies is most definetely the superior motive for this game. If you've got some friends and they like shooting zombies in the face with custom guns on custom maps, tell them to grab the game too. Still don't feel like this game is worth the $20? Buy it when it goes on sale for $5 during mostly any Steam sale. (Preferably the Summer Sale)  Go ahead and add this game to your wishlist, because although it was released in 2008 it is still my favorite Call of Duty game out there at the moment due to it's complexity compared to the other releases in the franchise.",1,let tell best call duty game pc definetely buy games price set get worth could possibly want game playing zombies mode dont like zombies check servers online hosted others online dont run hackerscheaters obviously people arent going buy game multiplayer aspect dont blame seeing zombies definetely superior motive game youve got friends like shooting zombies face custom guns custom maps tell grab game still dont feel like game worth buy goes sale mostly steam sale preferably summer sale go ahead add game wishlist although released still favorite call duty game moment due complexity compared releases franchise

"Counter-Strike (officially abbreviated as CS) is a series of multiplayer first-person shooter video games, in which teams of terrorists and counter-terrorists battle to, respectively, perpetrate an act of terror (bombing, hostage-taking) and prevent it (bomb defusal, hostage rescue). The series began on Windows in 1999 with the first version of Counter-Strike. It was initially released as a modification for Half-Life and designed by Minh 'Gooseman' Le and Jess 'Cliffe' Cliffe, before the rights to the game's intellectual property were acquired by Valve Corporation, the developers of Half-Life.  The game was followed-up with Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, developed by Turtle Rock Studios and released in 2004. Later that same year, Counter-Strike: Source was released by Valve. Released only eight months after Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, in November 2004, the game was a remake of the original Counter-Strike and the first in the series to run on Valve's newly created Source engine.[1] The fourth game in the main series to have been developed by Valve, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, was released in 2012 for Windows, OS X, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. Hidden Path Entertainment, who also worked on Counter-Strike: Source post-release, helped to develop the game alongside Valve.[2] Several spin-off titles have been released for Asian territories.",1,counterstrike officially abbreviated cs series multiplayer firstperson shooter video games teams terrorists counterterrorists battle respectively perpetrate act terror bombing hostagetaking prevent bomb defusal hostage rescue series began windows first version counterstrike initially released modification halflife designed minh gooseman le jess cliffe cliffe rights games intellectual property acquired valve corporation developers halflife game followedup counterstrike condition zero developed turtle rock studios released later year counterstrike source released valve released eight months counterstrike condition zero november game remake original counterstrike first series run valves newly created source engine fourth game main series developed valve counterstrike global offensive released windows os x xbox playstation hidden path entertainment also worked counterstrike source postrelease helped develop game alongside valve several spinoff titles released asian territories

"I like this game, but I do have some gripes with it. Why? It's ridicously expensive for a campaign that can be completed in roughly 3-4 hours and MP is kind of dead.   Those 3-4 hours of campaign gameplay is really well done. The mission briefings have some sort of footage, or graphical representation which I believe, is done really well. I remember when I bought this game on disc when it came out. People were saying, 'Why are they going back to WWII again?'  My answer to that is, because that is what they are known for.  This is Treyarch's first attempt in the Call of Duty franchise to compete to the hype that Infinity Ward did bring with the first few Call of Duty games, and the campaign was done well, however, it is really, REALLY short. Great footage, even had a snippet of General MacArthur's speech at the end of peace and acceptance in the aftermath of WWII.  Multiplayer back in its day was absolutely rubbish. It's not like the maps were bad or anything, but far out, why did they bring that stupid medic perk that brought people up from Last Stand. Last Stand is the worst perk ever in COD MP, as well as Martydom. I mean so people might be running around trying to revive people who are already breathing their last breaths. So one person has a perk that basically does not help them individually, but then they are encouraging people to use Last Stand on top of that. They just ruined Multiplayer in this game, because they were trying to make this like Battlefield, but that series is in it's own class.  Last Stand has been used in the end of campaigns since Modern Warfare, but it really helped in one part of this game. Nazi Zombies. Omg Treyarch, this is the best thing you have ever done. BUY THIS GAME FOR NAZI ZOMBIES TO PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS! This is where I recommend this game. Nazi Zombies is a fun game mode where you try to survive as many waves as you can. This is where you play strategically. Opening doors, buying power ups, getting random weapons including the Ray Gun, getting weapon upgrades (only in some maps).",1,like game gripes ridicously expensive campaign completed roughly hours mp kind dead hours campaign gameplay really well done mission briefings sort footage graphical representation believe done really well remember bought game disc came people saying going back wwii answer known treyarchs first attempt call duty franchise compete hype infinity ward bring first call duty games campaign done well however really really short great footage even snippet general macarthurs speech end peace acceptance aftermath wwii multiplayer back day absolutely rubbish like maps bad anything far bring stupid medic perk brought people last stand last stand worst perk ever cod mp well martydom mean people might running around trying revive people already breathing last breaths one person perk basically help individually encouraging people use last stand top ruined multiplayer game trying make like battlefield series class last stand used end campaigns since modern warfare really helped one part game nazi zombies omg treyarch best thing ever done buy game nazi zombies play friends recommend game nazi zombies fun game mode try survive many waves play strategically opening doors buying power ups getting random weapons including ray gun getting weapon upgrades maps

I can remember so many things about this game like the old PunkBuster anti-hacking program, the transfer from a standalone game to being forced to use Steam to play my Valve titles, the countless hackers using OGC and the amazing community created maps.

"Call of Duty: World at War is a lot like its predecessor, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. In most respects, this is a good thing. The guns are tightly tuned, the tone is gritty and mature, and the action is exciting and fast-paced. It boasts the same addictive multiplayer system as Modern Warfare, and even expands the multiplayer possibilities by allowing four players to play through the campaign cooperatively. Like every game in the series before Modern Warfare, this Call of Duty takes place during World War II. World at War does an admirable job of spicing things up, but between the well-worn source material and déjà vu game mechanics, there is a pervasive familiarity to the game. Still, though World at War lacks the freshness that made Modern Warfare such a hit, it nevertheless provides a hearty, filling meal--one that shooter fans are sure to savor.  The most salient difference between World at War and Modern Warfare is the WWII setting. In the campaign, you split time between two soldiers in two offensive theaters: the Russian push out of their homeland and into the heart of Germany, and the American struggle to wrest Pacific islands from the Japanese. Though you'll alternate between them every few levels, the campaign feels like one solid progression, thanks to the adept pacing.  Each soldier's journey begins at a low point. Weaponless and surrounded by the enemy, you get a taste of the despair many soldiers are never rescued from. Though the emotional tone eventually rises toward triumph, you never quite forget the fate you nearly met. The first few levels are a hard scrabble as you and your fellow soldiers try to gain a foothold for your country, while later levels are suffused with a sense of hard-won momentum as you fight bigger battles and push closer to your enemies' capitals. Throughout each level you are accompanied by a superior officer who sets the emotional tone through well-acted dialogue. The vengeful, spitfire Russian pumps up your adrenaline to intoxicating levels, while the grim, determined American provides a sobering influence. This grim sobriety is further enforced by the actual WWII videos, photos, and statistics presented in stylish interchapter cutscenes. The message is, by nature, a conflicted one: Though you may feel like an action hero, you are actually participating in the most horrid of human endeavors. How you ultimately feel about this message will depend on your personal disposition, but suffice to say that the elevated emotional timbre makes for an exciting campaign.  Also exciting? Bayonets and flamethrowers, the two standout new weapons in World at War. You wield both in the American campaign, using them to enthusiastically dispatch enemies in trenches and fend off the aggressive banzai raiders. These raiders snipe from the treetops, or pop out of holes and charge you with merciless determination; this aggression makes the American campaign feel uniquely tense. The Russian campaign is slightly more predictable, but it remains vigorous throughout and ends in a spectacularly satisfying way. Explosions and gunfire will cause enemies to lose limbs and copious amounts of blood, making World at War a sight more violent than Modern Warfare. Still, in between the burning, stabbing, and gibbing, there is a lot of crouching behind cover and picking off enemies with your trusty rifle. This kind of action, and most of the other weapons, will feel familiar to anyone who has played a World War II shooter before. It's a well-tuned and exciting familiarity, but it doesn't make any notable leaps.  World at War does make a leap for the Call of Duty series by offering two-player split-screen and four-player online cooperative campaign play. It's the same campaign as the single-player experience, though the number of enemies increases for every player that joins you. You can turn competitive scoring on and see who can earn the most points by killing enemies or reviving teammates, and this adds a bit of fun to the campaign and lightens to mood (it's hard to feel grim when there are point values popping up all the time). There are also special items called death cards in each level, and collecting these will allow you to enable a cheat for cooperative play (for instance, enemies die by headshots only or headshots cause enemies to explode). These add a little more spice to the pot, but the only tangible incentives are challenges. Completing these tasks (such as kill 100 enemies with pistols or take first 20 times in competitive co-op) will earn you experience points that go toward your multiplayer rank (co-op is not similarly ranked). Cooperative play is fun in its own right, but linking it to the addictive multiplayer ranking system makes it relevant in a whole different way.  In case you missed it last year, the multiplayer system introduced in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is fantastic, and World at War has updated it to fit its WWII setting. The hook is experience points, which you gain by winning matches or completing one of the aforementioned challenges. As you earn these points, you'll rank up and earn access to new weapons, new accessories (like sights and suppressors), and new perks. Perks are special abilities that grant you a wide variety of bonuses, but you can only choose four (one of which is vehicle-specific). This introduces an engaging element of customization: Will you choose to toughen up by increasing your health and bullet damage, or will you go the stealth route and increase your sprint speed while becoming invisible to enemy recon planes? Perks are well balanced, and you have multiple save slots, which enable you to easily switch between your various pretweaked loadouts. This allows you to take full advantage of this deep, engaging system that is just as great this year as it was last year, albeit slightly less novel.  There are, of course, new maps, and the bonuses you earn for kill streaks have been updated (notably, the attack helicopter you earned after seven kills in Modern Warfare is now a pack of nasty attack dogs). There are also a few maps that support tanks, powerful additions that mix things up without being too dominant. Most of the modes remain the same, though some have received slight tweaks and Capture the Flag has returned after a hiatus from Modern Warfare. The most striking new mode is actually a cooperative game called Nazi Zombies, playable when you beat the campaign (or play with someone who has). This absurd game puts up to four players in a house that is being assaulted by the undead. Killing the fiends and repairing the barricades earns you points that you then spend to replenish ammunition, buy new guns, and unlock new areas of the house. Each subsequent wave brings tougher, faster, more numerous enemies, and the game inevitably ends in grisly death. Though the random weapon box, assorted power-ups, and skills of your teammates add some variation, each play-through is similar to the last. Still, it makes for some intense, frantic fun and provides a welcome, if slightly bizarre, change of pace.  By staying largely true to the formula that made Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare so successful, Call of Duty: World at War has ensured a proven level of technical quality, particularly in the multiplayer arena. On the other hand, one of Modern Warfare's strengths was its fresh approach, and by embracing a familiar setting and familiar mechanics, World at War achieves greatness but falls short of excellence. This is only a bad thing if you are expecting this game to top its benchmark predecessor. If, however, you are hoping for an exciting campaign, fun cooperative play, and engaging multiplayer action, then you'll find a lot to be happy about in World at War.",1,call duty world war lot like

I guess this would be a good game for unimaginative people who need to be hand held the entire time, and think a good game consists of dying until you discover the secret passage through each level",-1,bought game reviews dont believe game horrible btw kiefer sutherland platton sgt first level like yelling half hour completely linear one one way get every mission matter skilled die die die follow mission perfectly way intend play lots invisible walls foot hedges cant jump lots triggers based movement dumb dumber programming slowest runner crawler ever served military invisible grenades come nowhere kill even every enemy within grenadesreach dead game cheats like btich enemy always knows position matter well covered much stealth time take approaching could go guess would good game unimaginative people need hand held entire time think good game consists dying discover secret passage level

"Custom zombies, that is all you need to know.  Considered by most people who used to play call of duty a lot to be one of the last great games in the series before it turned into simply awful updated versions every year for good reason.  Custom zombies is pretty much the best thing about the PC version, who needs Black Ops zombie maps when there are lots of remakes of the maps out there for WaW, and maps like Leviathan that completely bring the Black Ops zombie experience to World at War?  All the multiplayer maps and zombie maps that would otherwise have been DLC on the console versions, are free on the Steam version.  Multiplayer even after over 8 years since the game's original release, and unlike the console version still maintains a strong community, mostly comprised of modded lobbies but still an alive functioning multiplayer community.  Multiplayer community has little to no 'squeakers' we have come to know throughout the years of Call of Duty, World at War being an old game is long since abandoned by the masses of children that flock to Black Ops 3 and Advanced Warfare because of their shiny new graphics.  Campaign throws you into the first person control of two Allied soldiers, US Marine C. Miller, and Private Dimitri Petrenko of the 3rd Shock Army, taking you deep into the forests of Peleliu Island, the urban labyrinth of Berlin from the ruins of Stalingrad and the ruthlessness of a japanese outpost.  Historical accuracy is alright if you're OCD about that thing, there isn't too much historical inaccuracy in the game and it is not enough to put you off.",1,custom zombies need know considered people used play call duty lot one last great games series turned simply awful updated versions every year good reason custom zombies pretty much best thing pc version needs black ops zombie maps lots remakes maps waw maps like leviathan completely bring black ops zombie experience world war multiplayer maps zombie maps would otherwise dlc console versions free steam version multiplayer even years since games original release unlike console version still maintains strong community mostly comprised modded lobbies still alive functioning multiplayer community multiplayer community little squeakers come know throughout years call duty world war old game long since abandoned masses children flock black ops advanced warfare shiny new graphics campaign throws first person control two allied soldiers us marine c miller private dimitri petrenko rd shock army taking deep forests peleliu island urban labyrinth berlin ruins stalingrad ruthlessness japanese outpost historical accuracy alright youre ocd thing isnt much historical inaccuracy game enough put

"Made by Valve Software in 2000, originaly a mod for Half-Life in 1999. The most recently update is known as version 1.6. This game isn't balanced: the Desert Eagle is TO overpowered, USP too, rest of the pistols are mostly useless. The SMGs are quite good, but not as good as the Assault RIfles thoe. If you play this game right now, then expect little kids, russians, or just some wierd guys, who somehow see trough walls and always kill you with a one shot in the head... But renember: this game is amazing, alot of nostalgia for it. I would recomend to buy Counter Strike: Global Offensive, because it is more balanced, better movement, actual physics, and renember: you CAN earn money!!

It's campaign is actually playable, the multiplayer is alright though I did not really feel the urge to ever play it, and then the zombies mode is brilliant. On consoles, you only get 4 zombie maps. On PC you get hundreds. Fan made maps usually out-perform Treyarch's, and a load of them are extremely fun with friends. This easily takes the spot of my favorite CoD game (forgive me Call of Duty 3).",1,feel like last good cod though put alot hours cod games mainly play multiplayer friends world war gritty world war ii story love much though comparing two kind dumb idea game saving private ryan world war ii fpss campaign actually playable multiplayer alright though really feel urge ever play zombies mode brilliant consoles get zombie maps pc get hundreds fan made maps usually outperform treyarchs load extremely fun friends easily takes spot favorite cod game forgive call duty

"Let me start off by saying that the Counter-Strike pack is a stand-alone product. You don't need the original Half-Life to play this game. In the retail package you get a full version of CS as well as Team Fortress Classic, Opposing Force multiplayer, and the Wanted, Redemption and Firearms mods. The entire pack is overflowing with multiplayer fun, but, of course, the real focus of the retail release is Counter-Strike.  There is a single-player component to CS and, while it provides a good primer, this mod is all about online action. You basically play a game of cat and mouse, with the mouse being a terrorist group and the cat a squad of counter-terrorists. As a terrorist, you're goal is to plant a bomb at a specific location or hold a group of hostages. As a counter-terrorist, it's your duty to defuse said bomb or rescue the ill-fated hostages. Taking out all players on the opposing side will also assure your victory.  CS is an action lover's dream, with games lasting only four or five minutes (if that in some cases) because, unlike Half-Life, one shot to the head can mean instant death. CS is the perfect mix between fast-action and realistic damage. You can't just absorb bullet after bullet and expect to walk away. Working as a team is a must and, while you're in the game, taking the lone wolf approach will often get you killed...and fast.  It's the team-based tactics that make CS so fun. I can't stress how important it is in this game to act as a team. If your team is on the defensive side you'll all benefit by creating a cohesive strategy. If you team is on the offensive side, you will all benefit by sticking closely together as well. I'm sure you've seen movies or television show demonstrating this 'Conga Line' style of infiltration. Well, that's exactly how your team will have to act. This creates a fantastic game balance that will keep you coming back for more. It'll also keep you from thinking about your school work, your job, and interaction with your loved ones, and often work around the IGN offices will be put on hold so we can clog our network with CS.  Visually the game will not disappoint. While the Half-Life engine isn't the prettiest beast out there, there is plenty of animation that creates a smooth look and feel, and the gun models are some of the most realistic looking of any shooter available. The environmental textures look realistic enough and complement the provided camouflage well enough for you to be hidden, but not be invisible. As in real life, the distinguishable difference between good guy and bad guy is a little difficult, but the balance to this is if you can't tell who it is then you probably won't be able to hit him with your gun. Now, if you've purchased sniper rifle, you should have plenty of scope magnification to tell the difference between terrorist or counter-terrorist, but otherwise you may be taking out a team member from afar.  As good as it is, a couple of features of this game really stood out as frustrating... at first. But over a period of time they actually became enhancements to online multiplayer gaming. One feature is buying your weapons at the start of each round. This takes a little getting used to at first since, in most shooters, you just run around picking up weapons at your heart's content. Usually by the time you figured out which guns, grenades, and armor you were going to take in your early games, the bad guys would come over and kill you. But a couple of tries later, after getting the gist of things, you're off in no time. The other feature that took some getting used to was the 'wait and watch' feature after you get killed. Once you sustain a lethal injury, you have to wait for the next round to start before you can join in again -- you don't just spawn again and start shooting. This actually adds a ton of anxiety to your efforts of staying alive and completing your objective. But like I mentioned before, the rounds are short, so you shouldn't have to wait too long before you can jump in the action again.  Not surprisingly, the user interface is very Half-Life-esque. Gamers who have played Half-Life or any of the other mods for the game will have no trouble with the menu system. Even for the first time user the interface is easy to use or fumble through. The only thing that even slightly tripped us up in the interface is the 'Update' on the server page. First-time users may be confused into thinking this meant update my version of CS. Not true, it actually means update the list of game servers. But the rest of the interface is easy to understand and even easier to navigate.  Just about the only aspect of this game that we could make negative comments about is the sound. Sure, the realistic guns sounds are spot on, we just wish the same amount of attention to detail was given to the rest of the sound in the game. Some levels have lighting and thunder. When the thunder crashes it sounds a little wimpy. We were hoping for some deeper bass and clearer sounding claps from the lightning. In most of the level the user can go inside or out side of buildings, the sound of their footsteps should also change to reflect what type of surface they are walking on. The sound of footsteps getting closer and closer could also have been improved. As it stands now, it's hard to tell how far down the hallway or street a bad guy is from you by sound alone.  So how long does the magic last? Well we've been playing this game for over a year now and we still can't get enough of it. Are we tired of it? Hell no! We're still surprised by how fun this game is. This game actually made some of us squeal like little school-girls after getting sniped from an unexpected angle on high. On the other hand some of us were drawn to stand up and scream obscenities at the monitor. I guess we'll just have to get them next time!  In a nutshell, if you're looking for the next step in online first person shooters, then look no further. CS is fast paced, intense, and satisfying--this game will not disappoint. This is truly one of the best mods for one of the all time greatest first person shooters ever, and the retail package of CS is simply bursting with multiplayer goodness.

"Athough this isn't my first counter strike game nor my favorite, I still get this huge sense of nostalgia towards it. That late 90's FPS feel and the gritty nature of a low-budget mod gives the game it's charm.   Some things have not aged well, such as a search bar for server and the lack of customization options for your crosshair; i dunno, maybe I'm just spoiled.   This is probably the most difficult in the series for newcomers to get used to, but once you get the hand of the often clunkey controls and movement, it'll be an enjoyable experience.

"I originally had this for PS3, but I moved on to the PC version due to the fact that hackers were invading the console versions, unforunately.  Although I can't remember the last time I played the campaign online, it's a very enjoyable one with an okay story. It's also fun when playing with friends, too.  To me, the multiplayer hasn't changed from the console versions. However, the only 2 things I find different in this version are no hackers and dedicated servers. It's still fun and memorable to play, though.  The variety of custom content this game has to offer is mainly the reason why I got this game on PC (I do sometimes play multiplayer and campaign occasionally, though).  Custom zombies is by far one of the greatest modes I've ever played, and as time passes by, more custom content keeps getting put in along with fantastic-looking maps.  From custom weapons (from other CoD games) and custom game modes to mysterious easter eggs which you can complete (similiar to the ones in BO1 and BO2), I can easily guarantee you that half (if not, most of) the time that you put into this game will mainly be because of custom zombies.  If you're a fan of zombie-slaying or if you're just looking for a good CoD game to play, don't miss out on this,",1,originally ps moved pc version due fact hackers invading console versions unforunately although cant remember last time played campaign online enjoyable one okay story also fun playing friends multiplayer hasnt changed console versions however things find different version hackers dedicated servers still fun memorable play though variety custom content game offer mainly reason got game pc sometimes play multiplayer campaign occasionally though custom zombies far one greatest modes ive ever played time passes custom content keeps getting put along fantasticlooking maps custom weapons cod games custom game modes mysterious easter eggs complete similiar ones bo bo easily guarantee half time put game mainly custom zombies youre fan zombieslaying youre looking good cod game play dont miss

"Counter-Strike was the game that changed everything for me in FPS games, coming from older games like the FPS Game Blood back in (1997) when I was only 10 years old and Half-Life, Counter-Strike changed everything for me it was litterally the best thing ever.  The quality of the game was never about the visuals for me but about the game play and performance and Counter-Strike litterally had it all in my opinion.  Even today after so many years, I occasionally come back and play Counter-Strike just because it is one of the greatest Counter-Strike versions flat out, anyone disputing this are most likely people that started playing either Counter-Strike: Source or Counter-Strike: Global Offensive first then tried Counter-Strike but if you played it in the right order there is no disputing this, because this game might frighten most the new generation that has expectations to visual graphics having to have a certain standard before they will even touch it.  Counter-Strike is not about the visuals, that is just a bonus, if you want visuals then you probably playing the wrong game, Counter-Strike was never Battlefield nor CoD which probably to many looks visually stunning.  If you want quality in a game then Counter-Strike is one of the best games to play and get, hence why I am recommending this game.",1,counterstrike game changed everything fps games coming older games like fps game blood back years old halflife counterstrike changed everything litterally best thing ever quality game never visuals game play performance counterstrike litterally opinion even today many years occasionally come back play counterstrike one greatest counterstrike versions flat anyone disputing likely people started playing either counterstrike source counterstrike global offensive first tried counterstrike played right order disputing game might frighten new generation expectations visual graphics certain standard even touch counterstrike visuals bonus want visuals probably playing wrong game counterstrike never battlefield cod probably many looks visually stunning want quality game counterstrike one best games play get hence recommending game
I don't think there is much to say about this game since it has been said already. I enjoy playing it even though I suck at it. A lot.

"In my opinion, one of the best COD's to ever be created. I also reccomend this because it was made by Treyarch who made the only recent COD I thought was fun (BO2).

This is just one of those games you need to try out.",1,opinion one best cods ever created also reccomend made treyarch made recent cod thought fun bo although game skips years war amazing expierence even today luckily ww genre uprising one games need try

It also helps set up Black Ops campaign, as some character in this game will be referenced, and even in Black Ops, so this is a great starter game if your new to the franchise, or if you are one of those people who wants to see how COD got popular in the first place.",1,best campaign cod ive played multiplayer zombies pretty much dead still pick campaign really well done best cod game plus introduces classic zombies crew dlc packaged already also helps set black ops campaign character game referenced even black ops great starter game new franchise one people wants see cod got popular first place
"Unlike with my Black Ops 2 review, this game comes as one game under your Steam Library but is a 3 part game, Campaign, Multiplayer and Zombies. So i will be doing the one review for the parts individually.   WaW - Campaign   Its Veteran Campaign is the hardest campaign i have ever completed on any game ever. Regardless of wether it is a CoD or Battlefield or friggin' The Sims, i don't care it's purely hard. Unfortunately (Or fortunately in this case) the Steam version of this game does not have achievements so i cannot prove i have completed it on Veteren, and honestly i havent completed it on Veteren on Steam. I completed the Veteren campaign on the PS3 version of this game a long while back before i started PC gaming. After having gotten every single achievement and my Platinum Trophy i vowed to never ever ever attempt this Veteren Campaign again. As i said earlier unfortunately this version doesnt have achievements so i dont have enough reason to attempt such a feat again to prove my worth.   I can assure you back in the day there was much rage, controller throwing and much swearing loudly. I have since barely ever raged again, im pretty sure it's because no matter how hard something is or how much better a player in a multiplayer game is than me, there is always this Veteren campaign that is harder.  Having said all of that i really enjoyed the campaign, despite it being clearly quite old by todays standards it's quite a fun campaign (as long as you are not attempting it on Veteren)   WaW - Multiplayer   This game is old and this does reflect in the multiplayer games. There are quite a lot of One Shot lobbies in the multiplayer mode, it seems to be the more popular due to how much fun the sniper rifles are in this game and how old it is too i guess. You can find some normal team deathmatch games here too but its not a super busy game on the multiplayer servers from what i have seen, most people will have moved on to the newer CoD multiplayer games i imagine.   WaW - Zombies   This is the game mode that you buy this game for. World at War created Zombies, this was the first ever CoD game to put a zombies mode in. Having said that you only get one base map which isnt that great. What is pretty great is that all of the DLC for the Steam version of this game is completely free so you can get 3 other zombies maps too. This is unlike the PS3 version i played many moons ago in which i had to buy all the DLC. The DLC Zombies maps on this game do pale in comparison to the newer CoD games with zombies but that is to be expected since its the first time they have existed in CoD.  So that is awesome you have 4 zombies maps just like the console versions.   LOL. This is PC ♥♥♥♥♥ES!!!!   For the PC version of this game you have a WHOLE COMMUNITY based on ZOMBIES. There are literally THOUSANDS of Custom Built maps for this game. You can find such maps all completely FREE to download at many numorous websites that host links to maps made by Custom Mappers. You can see hundreds and thousands of videos on Youtube if you pretty much just type 'custom zombies' into youtube search bar to see huge varieties of maps. There are maps that are designed entierly from the map makers imagination or maps made based on real life enviroments wether it be the mappers workplace, house or local supermarket. There are maps based on TV shows such as The Simpsons, Family Guy, Spongebob Squarepants, My Little Pony - Yes i said My Little Pony!!  Even i myself have made a few custom maps - the mod tools are free for anyone to use to create your own maps usually available from the many websites that host these maps alongside tutorials on how to use them and many forum posts giving advice on how to use them.  So that is why you buy this game pretty much only for the custom zombies maps, you could spend probably over 2000 hours playing every single map for like 30 minutes each easy with probably some maps you could spend a few hours playing.  Some of the websites you can find custom maps and tutorials on how to make your own etc:   zombiemodding.com    ugx-mods.com    undeadmodding.com    triple-mgames.com   and so on, there are tonnes of them :P",1,unlike black ops review game comes one game steam library part game campaign multiplayer zombies one review parts individually waw campaign veteran campaign hardest campaign ever completed game ever regardless wether cod battlefield friggin sims dont care purely hard unfortunately fortunately case steam version game achievements cannot prove completed veteren honestly havent completed veteren steam completed veteren campaign ps version game long back started pc gaming gotten every single achievement platinum trophy vowed never ever ever attempt veteren campaign said earlier unfortunately version doesnt achievements dont enough reason attempt feat prove worth assure back day much rage controller throwing much swearing loudly since barely ever raged im pretty sure matter hard something much better player multiplayer game always veteren campaign harder said really enjoyed campaign despite clearly quite old todays standards quite fun campaign long attempting veteren waw multiplayer game old reflect multiplayer games quite lot one shot lobbies multiplayer mode seems popular due much fun sniper rifles game old guess find normal team deathmatch games super busy game multiplayer servers seen people moved newer cod multiplayer games imagine waw zombies game mode buy game world war created zombies first ever cod game put zombies mode said get one base map isnt great pretty great dlc steam version game completely free get zombies maps unlike ps version played many moons ago buy dlc dlc zombies maps game pale comparison newer cod games zombies expected since first time existed cod awesome zombies maps like console versions lol pc es pc version game whole community based zombies literally thousands custom built maps game find maps completely free download many numorous websites host links maps made custom mappers see hundreds thousands videos youtube pretty much type custom zombies youtube search bar see huge varieties maps maps designed entierly map makers imagination maps made based real life enviroments wether mappers workplace house local supermarket maps based tv shows simpsons family guy spongebob squarepants little pony yes said little pony even made custom maps mod tools free anyone use create maps usually available many websites host maps alongside tutorials use many forum posts giving advice use buy game pretty much custom zombies maps could spend probably hours playing every single map like minutes easy probably maps could spend hours playing websites find custom maps tutorials make etc zombiemoddingcom ugxmodscom undeadmoddingcom triplemgamescom tonnes p

Custom Zombies are amazing, some of the maps being as good as those made by Treyarch, some even better. Even after owning this game for so long, I find myself going back it when a talented person releases a new map. Trust me, Zombie Fans, this game is worth a purchase.

"Infinity Wards WWII Russian campaigns have always been the weakest of the Original Call Of Duty games for me, usually with no central ally unlike the other nations campaigns which included Captain Foley or Captain Price etc. It seems Treyarch learned from Infinity Wards mistake however because the Russian campaign in WaW is fantastic. Led throughout by Resnov through some brilliant missions culminating in a remake of the original Call Of Duty's assualt on the Berlin headquarters the Russian segment oozes quality. The US section however is the weakest this time around which doesn't make it bad just not up to the standard of the Russian campaign. The visuals in this game bring war torn streets and buildings of Europe to life like non of the previous games in the series and the enhanced body damage finally makes grenades and high powered machine guns satisfying as they rip through the bodies of your enemies.

"At first a third-party mod for Half-Life Deathmatch, Counter Strike became one of the most recognized and accoladed FPS's amongst the PC gaming community, and 1.6 is still going strong with hundreds of servers available free-to-play worldwide, even after the release of Source (the newer version of CS using the HL2 engine).   Nothing comes close to the intuitive physics and control provided by the old-school Half-Life 1 engine. Clever map design, in combination with a wide (but not overly-acclectic) collection of firearms and equipment at your disposal make for exciting deathmatch-style firefights as well as situtions requiring strategy and coordination with teamates.   The beauty of this game is it's simplicity, and diversity of action: There are no classes, no upgrades or bonuses, and nothing giving any player any sort of in-game advantage over another, save for skill and knowledge of the game. A large arsenal of uniquely-tuned weapons, CS's worldwide appeal and player base, and a plethora of every map type you could possibly imagine make for some very memorable gameplay experiences.",1,first thirdparty mod halflife deathmatch counter strike became one recognized accoladed fpss amongst pc gaming community still going strong hundreds servers available freetoplay worldwide even release source newer version cs using hl engine nothing comes close intuitive physics control provided oldschool halflife engine clever map design combination wide overlyacclectic collection firearms equipment disposal make exciting deathmatchstyle firefights well situtions requiring strategy coordination teamates beauty game simplicity diversity action classes upgrades bonuses nothing giving player sort ingame advantage another save skill knowledge game large arsenal uniquelytuned weapons css worldwide appeal player base plethora every map type could possibly imagine make memorable gameplay experiences

"Call of Duty: World at War. The last of the WW2 Call of Duties in the foreeable future. One of the better Call of Duties in general as well. What's not to like? Other than the outdated graphics by now, the story, characters, weapons, and experience are all amazing. This is by far the grittiest, dirtiest, most bloody, and dark COD yet. Limbs fly off in mortar strikes. Won't find that in COD: Ghosts. I found myself looking at the environments and architecture (especially the Reichstag) in amazement. The map design is so good. The mission variety is wide as well. Multiplayer is good too. Some hackers here and there but that is to be expected. I think what draws me in is the soundtrack and the dark feel of the title compared to others. Even the announcers in the multiplayer (Japanese and German especially) sound passionate and truly zealous about winning the match. So much effort was put into this title and I love it. Original Zombies too, nothing can beat the barebones feel. The PC port is pretty good but the controls and overall smoothness is slightly lacking compared to other COD's and other shooters. Takes about 5 minutes to get over and get used to though. Overall I think this is in the top 5, if not top 3, COD titles.",1,call duty world war last ww call duties foreeable future one better call duties general well whats like outdated graphics story characters weapons experience amazing far grittiest dirtiest bloody dark cod yet limbs fly mortar strikes wont find cod ghosts found looking environments architecture especially reichstag amazement map design good mission variety wide well multiplayer good hackers expected think draws soundtrack dark feel title compared others even announcers multiplayer japanese german especially sound passionate truly zealous winning match much effort put title love original zombies nothing beat barebones feel pc port pretty good controls overall smoothness slightly lacking compared cods shooters takes minutes get get used though overall think top top cod titles

"I can recommend it if you get it on sale, which is generally how I feel about most of the Call of Duty games.

One of the few PC games that gets into the Pacific Theater of WWII.  For as old as it is, the MP community is still fairly active, though predominately Zombies mode, which originated here.

"I didn't even play this game when I first reviewed it what the ♥♥♥♥ why did I review this  Counter-Strike. If you don't know what this game is, you should probably slap yourself and stop playing games because this ♥♥♥♥ literally founded multiplayer first-person shooters.  Okay, not 'founded', Quake did that first but it sure as hell helped them develop into what they are today.  While the graphics definitely haven't held up to standards today (kind of obvious since this game was released in ♥♥♥♥ING 2000 AND STARTED DEVELOPMENT IN 1999), this game is still fun. Why? There's a lot more maps in the game, and as a result of low graphical quality, it's a LOT easier to run on old systems or just bad systems in general. And the gameplay is still just as fun as CS:S or even CS:GO.  This game used to still be the 3rd most played game on Steam next to Team Fortress 2 (  ) and Dota 2, but that changed when CS:GO actually started to become a good game back in 2013. Now there's really only the most dedicated CS players that play this game.  I don't recommend going into this game unless you're a dedicated CS veteran who wants to relive the history of CS and see what the first game got everyone hyped for. This game's great, I'm not going to lie, it's just the learning curve as of right now is STEEP. And that can be good or bad for some people.  I'm definitely going to be spending more time in this game in the future just so I can get hours in the game and act like I'm actually good at Counter-Strike for once. That's about it, though.  ",1,didnt even play game first reviewed review counterstrike dont know game probably slap stop playing games literally founded multiplayer firstperson shooters okay founded quake first sure hell helped develop today graphics definitely havent held standards today kind obvious since game released ing started development game still fun theres lot maps game result low graphical quality lot easier run old systems bad systems general gameplay still fun css even csgo game used still rd played game steam next team fortress dota changed csgo actually started become good game back theres really dedicated cs players play game dont recommend going game unless youre dedicated cs veteran wants relive history cs see first game got everyone hyped games great im going lie learning curve right steep good bad people im definitely going spending time game future get hours game act like im actually good counterstrike thats though

"The campaign is at times glitchy. Sometimes, important AI (Roebuck, Reznov) just stand and do nothing at a checkpoint, and it sucks to have to restart an entire level because your AI friends just won't let you finish the mission. That being aside, it is a phenomenal story! I'd actually say it is about as good as CoD4's; CoD4 had more grueling and boring fights but a few more memorable cutscenes/missions. WaW's gunfights are more dynamic and brutal, but there aren't as many memorable cutscenes/missions; infantry and tanks just easily fall to your will, even on Veteran difficulty (the only hard part about Veteran is the grenade spam).  Multiplayer is pretty much a copy-paste of CoD4. If you enjoyed playing CoD4 multiplayer, you'd probably think of WaW multiplayer as something like a WWII mod version of CoD4. It plays very well, but it lacks innovation, really.  Zombies is what it's all about and the only reason why I bought WaW on Steam when I already owned a copy for Xbox 360. The original 4 maps are quite fun, especially since you can access the developer console and annihilate zombies with infinite ammo, god mode, etc. But that's just the beginning. Mods!!! Downloaded custom maps from the internet are SO EXTREMELY FUN! You get to see what someone else has thought up for Zombies, and it's so refreshing because the last time Treyarch released a new map was August, 2013, which was a long while ago. I definitely recommend maps made from UGX, TMG, and ZCT, but there are still several indie maps that bring loads of innovation.  *This is somewhat irrelevant to WaW, but I really hope Treyarch takes some Custom Zombies ideas for CoD 2015. Kino Der Toten was extremely uninnovative (copy-paste of Der Riese), and I was quite disappointed with the map when I first played BO Zombies. TranZit was a lot more innovative, but most of the new features were terrible trolls and not anything fun, really, so that left a sour taste on BO2 Zombies, too. Since AW is the newest CoD and is doing a terrible job with being a fun game to play, that makes it all the more important for Treyarch to revive the franchise.",1,campaign times glitchy sometimes important ai roebuck reznov stand nothing checkpoint sucks restart entire level ai friends wont let finish mission aside phenomenal story id actually say good cods cod grueling boring fights memorable cutscenesmissions waws gunfights dynamic brutal arent many memorable cutscenesmissions infantry tanks easily fall even veteran difficulty hard part veteran grenade spam multiplayer pretty much copypaste cod enjoyed playing cod multiplayer youd probably think waw multiplayer something like wwii mod version cod plays well lacks innovation really zombies reason bought waw steam already owned copy xbox original maps quite fun especially since access developer console annihilate zombies infinite ammo god mode etc thats beginning mods downloaded custom maps internet extremely fun get see someone else thought zombies refreshing last time treyarch released new map august long ago definitely recommend maps made ugx tmg zct still several indie maps bring loads innovation somewhat irrelevant waw really hope treyarch takes custom zombies ideas cod kino der toten extremely uninnovative copypaste der riese quite disappointed map first played bo zombies tranzit lot innovative new features terrible trolls anything fun really left sour taste bo zombies since aw newest cod terrible job fun game play makes important treyarch revive franchise

"After Treyarch spent most of their budget hiring mainstream Hollywood actors Kiefer Sutherland (better known as Big Boss in Metal Gear Solid 3, Metal Gear Solid 4, and Metal Gear Solid 5) and Gary Oldman (Die Hard), they were forced to reuse their art and sound assets, which meant a greater focus on the Eastern Front campaign. The Pacific campaign suffered as a result, being reduced to a paultry side story, leaving out the historic invasion of mainland Japan and the takeover of the Imperial Diet by elements of the US Marines. Not recommended for those of German or Japanese descent.",-1,treyarch spent budget hiring mainstream hollywood actors kiefer sutherland better known big boss metal gear solid metal gear solid metal gear solid gary oldman die hard forced reuse art sound assets meant greater focus eastern front campaign pacific campaign suffered result reduced paultry side story leaving historic invasion mainland japan takeover imperial diet elements us marines recommended german japanese descent

Pros:Barely any kids There's a lot of realism involved Actual recoil that's not fake engine trash. Snipers aren't offensive and snipers don't quickscope. Infact, it's impossible to quickscope since sniper in WaW actually takes skill on aiming because of breathing patterns and shuttering. Most alive CoD on PC Historically accurate on world war II.  Cons:WHAT ♥♥♥♥ING CONS? IT'S ONE OF THE BEST 'MODERN' FPSES EVER MADE.",1,good call duty people say older ones awesome mediocre compared prosbarely kids theres lot realism involved actual recoil thats fake engine trash snipers arent offensive snipers dont quickscope infact impossible quickscope since sniper waw actually takes skill aiming breathing patterns shuttering alive cod pc historically accurate world war ii conswhat ing cons one best modern fpses ever made

"It's Simply one of those games you will have fun with no matter how you play it. W@W is one of the best cod games in the franchise if not the best. It's also the first game in the series to introduce zombies. W@W goes back to it's roots with it's world war perspective bringing you both a taste of what history has to offer,as well as all the oldschool goodness with classic weaponry and so forth.this is also the last cod game to come out that had the simple 3 killstreaks before the games after it released introducing like 50,000 different killstreaks to choose from. The game uses and reamped the cod4 engine,so if you liked that game then chances are that you'll love this as well. Another cool thing about this game is that the gore is on point.it's the only cod game avaliable that allows dismemberments of your character when getting killed by explosives and even gunshots making it the most realistic cod game on the market. Myself personally prefers a shooter with a world war perspective because i like the gear and weaponry and such from those times,plus i was big on cod4 so i feel right at home with this game. I mainly play multiplayer more than anything,and zombies is always fun as well with some friends.even the campaign is great so you'll love that as well. I been on this game since it launched back in 2008 on ps3 and now it's 2014 and im still enjoying it on pc. Like i said,you'll love this game no matter how you play it.you also get the map packs free with your purchase for those who are wondering about that,and you can also play the campaign in co-op online as well. So yea,wether this game is $10-$20,it's def worth it!",1,simply one games fun matter play ww one best cod games franchise best also first game series introduce zombies ww goes back roots world war perspective bringing taste history offeras well oldschool goodness classic weaponry forththis also last cod game come simple killstreaks games released introducing like different killstreaks choose game uses reamped cod engineso liked game chances youll love well another cool thing game gore pointits cod game avaliable allows dismemberments character getting killed explosives even gunshots making realistic cod game market personally prefers shooter world war perspective like gear weaponry timesplus big cod feel right home game mainly play multiplayer anythingand zombies always fun well friendseven campaign great youll love well game since launched back ps im still enjoying pc like saidyoull love game matter play ityou also get map packs free purchase wondering thatand also play campaign coop online well yeawether game def worth

"This is by far my favorite Call of Duty game out of the franchise. Its a classic CoD game featuring missions by US Marines in the West Pacific and Soviet Troops in Eastern Europe/Western Asia. The missions are somewhat historical accurate which makes it really interesting to play and this was the first CoD with Nazi Zombies . You cant beat a classic game, with 1940's weapons and tanks. It includes a Sniper Mission in Stalingrad, a Blackcat plane gunner mission, and a Tank Battle in Seelow Heights, all the Nazi Zombie Maps, and a multiplayer feature. The multiplayer is pretty great I am the highest ranked prestiege. And from my experience there arnt as many hackers as your think. Theres the ability to kick them in some servers if you watch and catch them but they are very few in numbers and I have gone 25+ games without a aimbotter sometimes. I strongly reccomend this game for anyone trying to get a glimpse of what this huge CoD started out as.",1,far favorite call duty game franchise classic cod game featuring missions us marines west pacific soviet troops eastern europewestern asia missions somewhat historical accurate makes really interesting play first cod nazi zombies cant beat classic game weapons tanks includes sniper mission stalingrad blackcat plane gunner mission tank battle seelow heights nazi zombie maps multiplayer feature multiplayer pretty great highest ranked prestiege experience arnt many hackers think theres ability kick servers watch catch numbers gone games without aimbotter sometimes strongly reccomend game anyone trying get glimpse huge cod started

"Counter-strike, my childhood! Brings bad memories back...  One of the first Valve games, and this one is a total ♥♥♥♥. I understand why Half-life sucks so much, but how famous multiplayer trash shooter can be so badly made?! There is two teams, terrorist team and counter-terrorist team (both acts like scumbags). Your goal is to kill other team or place the bomb as terrorist. Allahu akbar! Never seen this before, bad guys can actually win. Its terrorism propaganda! Counter-strike playerbase is worst part of this, they dumb as ♥♥♥♥ and hot headed of course, alot of cheaters who cant play fair, this makes this game completely unplayable and innocent people get VAC ban (like me).

"I got this in the Activision sale and I have to say, I am REALLY pleased with my purchase. I actually played this to death on the Xbox 360 some years ago and really missed playing it. I had some initial concerns the multiplayer player count might be low, but how shocked was I to find not only is it thriving, but there are literally stacks of servers chock full of players of all ranks! I shouldn't imagine anyone having any trouble finding people to play with.  The Xbox360 version was great, but the PC version is a lot more polished. I was very surprised to see both my GTX780's being full utilized in SLI, making for very smooth frame rates. The game seemed to be capped @ 90fps, and at that it was buttery smooth as the action heats up. Graphically the game holds up well for a 2008 title, honestly I dont think 2013's CoD Ghosts looks much, if any better than this title.  I haven't played the campaign yet on PC, but I did on the Xbox360 and it was totally epic. So all in all I think you are getting a lot for your money, especially if you pick it up during a sale! I am personally a bit sick of all these futuristic shooters of late, and its been nice to return to a gritty WWII setting. The moment you get your PPSH-41 you know you're in for some fun!  - Highly recommended ",1,got activision sale say really pleased purchase actually played death xbox years ago really missed playing initial concerns multiplayer player count might low shocked find thriving literally stacks servers chock full players ranks shouldnt imagine anyone trouble finding people play xbox version great pc version lot polished surprised see gtxs full utilized sli making smooth frame rates game seemed capped fps buttery smooth action heats graphically game holds well title honestly dont think cod ghosts looks much better title havent played campaign yet pc xbox totally epic think getting lot money especially pick sale personally bit sick futuristic shooters late nice return gritty wwii setting moment get ppsh know youre fun highly recommended
When I try and play the game it crashes. After doing some research this seems to be a common problem and no one seems to know of a definite solution. Do not buy this game.

Steam has no warnings about compatability issues and a notoriously terrible refund policy.

"This is one of my favourite Call of Duty. Why? Because nowadays, Devs only concentrate on 'future' soldiers that have advanced technology and robots, which I mean used to be cool but hey, the future theme is saturated and it's really boring and unpleasant.  This game is obviously set in World War II which makes it interesting, you get to use old weapons such as a Thompson or an M1 Grand, or a gun I have never heard about (a Japanese Rifle) Arisaka. It's great to use variety of weapons that used to be in Medal of Honor games, I mean MoH used to be one of my favourite shooters as well.  What sets this game apart from other Call of Duty is that you can play and enjoy Campaign/Story Mode together up to 4 players. Other Call of Duty titles doesn't include this simple and easy feature that could be implemented without breaking a sweat or damaging their budget, I mean how hard is it to play co-op story mode with your friends, since they have a multiplayer already? That being said, the story is interesting and fun to play.   The story shifts from you being a Private in the US Army and a Private in the Red Army, the US gets to fight with the Japanese, and the Soviet Union deals with the Germans.   Nobody would give a crap about this review since it's a 7 year old game, but if you don't own it - grab it whilst it's on sale and get some friends to play Story Mode with you on Veteran difficulty, you'll have the best time.",1,one favourite call duty nowadays devs concentrate future soldiers advanced technology robots mean used cool hey future theme saturated really boring unpleasant game obviously set world war ii makes interesting get use old weapons thompson grand gun never heard japanese rifle arisaka great use variety weapons used medal honor games mean moh used one favourite shooters well sets game apart call duty play enjoy campaignstory mode together players call duty titles doesnt include simple easy feature could implemented without breaking sweat damaging budget mean hard play coop story mode friends since multiplayer already said story interesting fun play story shifts private us army private red army us gets fight japanese soviet union deals germans nobody would give crap review since year old game dont grab whilst sale get friends play story mode veteran difficulty youll best time

"The classic shooter upgraded with modern controls: Counter-Strike was something unseen, yet highly needed in the late 90's and early 00's. It carried with it the idea that you didn't need a single player 'story mode' to make ripples in the video game industry. As future competitors would attempt to reflect, all CS needed was an incredible skill-based gameplay with a start-of-the-art ability to play against players from around the world. Toss in some alternate gameplay styles to help break up the chance of monotonous moments and throw it all over a large assortment of levels for good measure; you’ll end up with a dish that, for years, has been best served with a dedicated server and a good group of friends. It's no wonder that CS gave birth to some of the best online team play the world has ever seen and continues in that tradition to this day. If you haven't played the original Counter-Strike yet, you're missing a small part of your soul... hurry, go get it back by quick scoping with an AWP down Long A on de_dust2.",1,classic shooter upgraded modern controls counterstrike something unseen yet highly needed late early carried idea didnt need single player story mode make ripples video game industry future competitors would attempt reflect cs needed incredible skillbased gameplay startoftheart ability play players around world toss alternate gameplay styles help break chance monotonous moments throw large assortment levels good measure youll end dish years best served dedicated server good group friends wonder cs gave birth best online team play world ever seen continues tradition day havent played original counterstrike yet youre missing small part soul hurry go get back quick scoping awp long dedust

"This is an honest review of Call of Duty: World at War    There's few games that really outshine this one. I've been playing this game for a long time, even though It says I've only got 70 or so hours at the moment. My favorite gamemode is by far the zombies, don't get me wrong, the campaign and multiplayer are fantastic. But the zombies is where this game really shines in my opinion.  Pros: -Awesome story -Huge multiplayer maps with vehicles  -Extremely realistic hardcore mode -Zombies -Custom, downloadable zombies and multiplaer maps -An actually quality level PC port  Cons: -Small-ish community -Very hard to get into low-ping public zombies servers -Graphics are outdated (not that it really matters to me, but it's a con for most people) -Crashes happen when you try to switch your online profile -Tanks are OP (as they should be, but its none the less annoying)  FINAL VERDICT:  Overall, You could have many hours of fun with your friends in this game. If you have no friends who play this game, it is less of a rewarding experience. If you do buy this game, I would highly recommend playing through the campaign, it is really worth your time.

"Call of Duty: World at War is easily the best PC CoD game you should get. It has an interesting campaign, following the events of WW2, as you take the roles of an American and later on Russian soldier. The multiplayer can be a bit annoying, because you join in a different way, using servers. Even if you manage to get your head past that, you still have grenade spammers, quick-scopers, 9 year old kids raging over their mic, etc. But by FAR the best thing about this is Zombies. Zombies is the type of game you can play over and over, mainly because practically anything can happen in a game. The community also love zombies and have made so many maps, you will never be able to play them all.

"The developers of the Half-Life Mod, Counter-Strike really knew what they were doing when they said they wanted to construct a mod like no other. It was, like Half-Life, something new for the public to lay their bored eyes on. There never before was a mod about Terrorism vs Counter Terrorism, and thanks to the two developers of the game, it happened. Why Terorrism vs Counter Terrorism though? It was only something new and that is it. It was something to literally 'wow' the public with intense competitive multiplayer gameplay. It was something people actually payed attention to and thought it off as a sport. So fourth, this mod has been recognized so much that more installments have appeared, and that is an amazing thing for a game that once started off as a mod. Just like Team Fortress and how that continued on into Team Fortress 2. I have yet to play Global Offensive but I will do that some time in the future.  Its games like these that always amaze me with their originality. And I believe Counter-Strike is one of those games that deserves to be noticed and introduced to FPS fans across the world.   This is a must buy/play.",1,developers halflife mod counterstrike really knew said wanted construct mod like like halflife something new public lay bored eyes never mod terrorism vs counter terrorism thanks two developers game happened terorrism vs counter terrorism though something new something literally wow public intense competitive multiplayer gameplay something people actually payed attention thought sport fourth mod recognized much installments appeared amazing thing game started mod like team fortress continued team fortress yet play global offensive time future games like always amaze originality believe counterstrike one games deserves noticed introduced fps fans across world must buyplay

"A lot of people give this software flak about what it is and what it does. But I'm here to clarify what this software is all about. It's an excellent modeling software with great and easy to use user interfaces from everything to UV mapping to basic sculpting. Does it crash, yes; but only sometimes and it also depends on how much your system can handle and how much your pushing the software. It's crashed on me while sculpting but only because I pushed it to it's extremes (which I said before, it's only ment for the basics when it comes to sculpting). But, when it comes to modeling for literally anything; the imagination behind it is the limit. I've used this software for practically everything during my associates degree in 3d modeling and animation for college assignments and it has been flawless for me (and I'm still using it to this very day and still have no complaints). You will also see that a lot of people argue that it needs updates. I would have to agree but, if they were to update it; it would have to be a very large one. For, their isn't really much to update. All in all, it's a great software and well worth the money in my opinion and recommend it to anyone interested or even already in 3d modeling.",1,lot people give software flak im clarify software excellent modeling software great easy use user interfaces everything uv mapping basic sculpting crash yes sometimes also depends much system handle much pushing software crashed sculpting pushed extremes said ment basics comes sculpting comes modeling literally anything imagination behind limit ive used software practically everything associates degree modeling animation college assignments flawless im still using day still complaints also see lot people argue needs updates would agree update would large one isnt really much update great software well worth money opinion recommend anyone interested even already modeling

There are a good variety of guns to choose from and maps and a good size. I have played Zombies by far the most, and it's definately the best part of this game!

" Call of Duty making its way back to the World War II for a while.   To put it briefly, Call of Duty: World at War is pretty much exactly like Call of Duty 4 as far as the engine goes, but what makes it different is that it is set in the World War II.  The single-player campaign shows said war from the perspective of a U.S. Marine, as well as a soldier fighting for the Soviet Union - unlike the first two Call of Duty titles, both of which had three arcs in the campaign. Though I am definitely not saying that this would make World at War worse, as in this case, less is indeed more. The campaign is really immersing and even though there is not much of 'that special story aspect' like Call of Duty 4 had, it still makes a great companion for a lazy afternoon. Yes, it is possible to finish the game in as little as 3 hours, which truly is not a lot even by today's standards, but if you are looking for more, the multiplayer has got you covered.  And is, too, very similar to the one in Call of Duty 4 - it features a ranking system with unlockables and challenges to keep you busy playing on the well-designed and balanced set of maps that this game has to offer. You also have the choice to use vehicles in combat, which is something entirely new.  Last but not least, World at War was the first to feature the, today already well-known, Treyarch speciality - Zombies. A great game mode for getting some emotions out. Basically, it involves shooting incoming waves of zombies, getting points for doing so, buying things to shoot with for said points, then repeating the process, effectively having fun - either on your own, or with a bunch of friends.  This game can be a blast if you are interested in World War II games, and I think it is, on sale, worth it even for the seemingly ridiculous price Activision wants for it.",1,call duty making way back world war ii put briefly call duty world war pretty much exactly like call duty far engine goes makes different set world war ii singleplayer campaign shows said war perspective us marine well soldier fighting soviet union unlike first two call duty titles three arcs campaign though definitely saying would make world war worse case less indeed campaign really immersing even though much special story aspect like call duty still makes great companion lazy afternoon yes possible finish game little hours truly lot even todays standards looking multiplayer got covered similar one call duty features ranking system unlockables challenges keep busy playing welldesigned balanced set maps game offer also choice use vehicles combat something entirely new last least world war first feature today already wellknown treyarch speciality zombies great game mode getting emotions basically involves shooting incoming waves zombies getting points buying things shoot said points repeating process effectively fun either bunch friends game blast interested world war ii games think sale worth even seemingly ridiculous price activision wants

Add the lemon zest and juice and mix until combined. Pour over the crust and bake about 20 minutes.  4. Allow to cool in the fridge for a minimum of 2 hours, then sift powdered sugar over the top before cutting into squares.  (Use an 8 x 10 pan if you'd like the layers to be a little thicker.)

"WW2 Call of Duty which was released right after Modern Warfare 1. Includes a fairly entertaining 2-3 hr long campaign where you play as Americans in the Pacific and Russians on the western front. Lots of gibs, gore, and a somewhat active multiplayer can be expected.   (Lots of empty servers, but still a few with a good amount of people on them.)  Players can also control tanks in multiplayer on maps that are big enough to support them. T34 and a Panzer IV. Players may also choose from various tank related perks (increase turret rotation, reload, top speed, etc.) as well as various anti-tank measures such as equipping yourself with AT grenades, a bazooka, satchel charges, etc.  I'm not a huge Call of Duty fan but I have a lot of fun with this.",1,ww call duty released right modern warfare includes fairly entertaining hr long campaign play americans pacific russians western front lots gibs gore somewhat active multiplayer expected lots empty servers still good amount people players also control tanks multiplayer maps big enough support panzer iv players may also choose various tank related perks increase turret rotation reload top speed etc well various antitank measures equipping grenades bazooka satchel charges etc im huge call duty fan lot fun

"The hand models, animations, weapon textures, and custom maps all make this game an enjoyable experience. Oh yeah but just add functional bots so I dont have to download ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Z-Bots, which, are not realistic in any way possible (aimbot, movement patterns, staring contests with enemies).  Although the game is a classic representation of how modernized tactical shooters should be produced, the hackers are always going to be there to ruin the fun. Also, some seriously dysfunctional hit detection occurs during most matches. Also, not trying to be too judgemental, but the game would have been a lot easier to play if the crosshairs had center dots. I say this because Source and G.O. have center crosshair dots, which make aiming much more persistent.   ***8.5/10***  Final Statement:  It's a damn ugly game, but that's what makes it good. Once modded, it can look like it runs on a completely different engine. However, the detail and missing physics are not present due to the limitations of GoldSrc's dated capabilities. Oh, and this game does not deserve to be ran with mods. Just simple and complex retextures of the weapons provided within the game. I would like to tell you that this game is better than Source and G.O., but half the community sticks to the newer iterations rather than the original.",1,hand models animations weapon textures custom maps make game enjoyable experience oh yeah add functional bots dont download zbots realistic way possible aimbot movement patterns staring contests enemies although game classic representation modernized tactical shooters produced hackers always going ruin fun also seriously dysfunctional hit detection occurs matches also trying judgemental game would lot easier play crosshairs center dots say source go center crosshair dots make aiming much persistent final statement damn ugly game thats makes good modded look like runs completely different engine however detail missing physics present due limitations goldsrcs dated capabilities oh game deserve ran mods simple complex retextures weapons provided within game would like tell game better source go half community sticks newer iterations rather original

"Call of Duty: World at War is the 5th Call of Duty game and the most recent to transpire in a World War II setting.   The game is extremely fun. It has the BEST campaign out of any Call of Duty game. It is a campaign you will play for fun, not to say you beat it. The multiplayer is also really fun, with many perks and guns to keep it feeling fresh. Lastly, there is the Nazi Zombies mode. Four maps bundled with the game, all 4 of which are very fun solo and co-op. But here is the long-lasting appeal for it. CUSTOM. ZOMBIES. There are a bunch of custom maps that other users have made. Just download and install them. Very easy. A lot of them are very good. A lot are original content, and there are also a couple remakes. I have seen Kino Der Toten, and there is also Origins, but at the time it is a work in progress.  However, there are some downsides. It is an old game. The multiplayer community is dead. There are around 7 servers left, though they are full of veteran players. The Zombies community, in a sense, is dead as well. Wanna join a game of Zombies with randoms? Good luck. No servers are up. Your only option is with friends or to roll in solo.  In spite of the cons, Call of Duty: World at War is a great game, and I feel that everybody should pick it up.  SCORE: 92/100  CONCLUSION One of the best Call of Duty games, and is well worth it on PC. Just make sure you have friends with this game as well, because there is not really much of a community left on PC.",1,call duty world war th call duty game recent transpire world war ii setting game extremely fun best campaign call duty game campaign play fun say beat multiplayer also really fun many perks guns keep feeling fresh lastly nazi zombies mode four maps bundled game fun solo coop longlasting appeal custom zombies bunch custom maps users made download install easy lot good lot original content also couple remakes seen kino der toten also origins time work progress however downsides old game multiplayer community dead around servers left though full veteran players zombies community sense dead well wanna join game zombies randoms good luck servers option friends roll solo spite cons call duty world war great game feel everybody pick score conclusion one best call duty games well worth pc make sure friends game well really much community left pc
