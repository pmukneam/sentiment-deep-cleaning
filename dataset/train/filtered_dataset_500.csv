"This game has been around for a long time... so long that a lot of people think the game is what it was years ago when it first came out... its not  It was the first game I ever bought on steam. and I can honestly say that it was a huge part of the last few years of my life. even if i havnt played it in a year  I would do some pretty crazy things to relive this game for the first time. It was an experience I will never forget and will always remember. And even with that this game has some of the best replayability that ive seen, especially if you play through it with a friend or family member. Which were just as amazing as playing for the first time. That is truly were this game shines. In a co-op style playthrough...   but with that being said, onto the game itself...  The first thing i feel i need to note is the soundtrack. while its not going to nock your socks off, anyone who knows what im talking about knows that when you havnt played this game in forever, and you sit down to play it again. The sound track is what gets you. Its nostalgia factor is through the roof and for the new player is something to experience. Really its almostt required to have music eneabled your first time through...  Now alot of people see this game and immediately come to a conclusion. That it is a 2 dimensional knock off of a certain other blocky game. To that person I say this: You couldnt be more wrong...  That game is survival game and this is in no way a survival game. Yes you chop down trees to build a house and tools. but that is pretty much it. The point of the game is to defeat bosses and get loot. its so much closer to a immersive deungon crawler than a survival game. There is no hunger, there is no thirst. There is only health and mana for your magic weapons. Yes there is mining but not that kind of mining. When you go underground your searching for rare monsters and chests with loot. and deungons. Real deungons not a square with a monster copy and paster. There are 18 bosses and 12 events. there are 360 waepons and 270 accesories. Its all about becming stronger and beating enemies and exploring.  Im not trying to bash minecraft at all. 9 year old me loved that game. Im just trying to say that these 2 games are completely different and have nothing to do with eachother.  The games great, get it on sale or at regualar price since its dirt cheap and I promise you wont regret it.",1,game around long time long lot people think game years ago first came first game ever bought steam honestly say huge part last years life even havnt played year would pretty crazy things relive game first time experience never forget always remember even game best replayability ive seen especially play friend family member amazing playing first time truly game shines coop style playthrough said onto game first thing feel need note soundtrack going nock socks anyone knows im talking knows havnt played game forever sit play sound track gets nostalgia factor roof new player something experience really almostt required music eneabled first time alot people see game immediately come conclusion dimensional knock certain blocky game person say couldnt wrong game survival game way survival game yes chop trees build house tools pretty much point game defeat bosses get loot much closer immersive deungon crawler survival game hunger thirst health mana magic weapons yes mining kind mining go underground searching rare monsters chests loot deungons real deungons square monster copy paster bosses events waepons accesories becming stronger beating enemies exploring im trying bash minecraft year old loved game im trying say games completely different nothing eachother games great get sale regualar price since dirt cheap promise wont regret

"Fantastic game! In my opinion even though it is a little older, it's one of the best strategy games to date. You can easily get lost in it for hours upon hours as evident from my 230+ hours spent on it. In all that time I have not won a single campaign on the normal world domination setting. Now this either means I'm a complete moron, or this game is very challenging as any strategy game should be. I'm personally hoping for the later...  The downside to this game however, is the time it takes between turns. Even when you have the 'show computer turns' setting checked off, it takes a good 5 to 8 minutes, or at least it seems for it to go through all the A.I. turns. This is very annoying, and it does suddenly crash once in a while, so it's best to always remember to save.  Overall I would recommend this game to any true strategy game lover!",1,fantastic game opinion even though little older one best strategy games date easily get lost hours upon hours evident hours spent time single campaign normal world domination setting either means im complete moron game challenging strategy game im personally hoping later downside game however time takes turns even show computer turns setting checked takes good minutes least seems go ai turns annoying suddenly crash best always remember save overall would recommend game true strategy game lover

"More of a casual RPG that has pretty decent story and not a bad leveling system. This game was originally supposed to be an MMO but was modified part way through the development process into a single player game (and it shows from level design and region/zone layout and parsing, to combat, to the inventory system, and so on). Overall an ok RPG that leaves you with a somewhat positive experience (not as bland or trope heavy as Dragon Age but no where near any of the Elder Scroll games).",1,casual rpg pretty decent story bad leveling system game originally supposed mmo modified part way development process single player game shows level design regionzone layout parsing combat inventory system overall ok rpg leaves somewhat positive experience bland trope heavy dragon age near elder scroll games

"I think Terraria is a great game, but i do want to give a serious review to inform anybody who wants to look at this game and plans on buying it.  Pros: -Tons of replayability -Easy to grasp gameplay -Unique bosses and weapons... Like a sword that shoots nyan cats -Rewarding exploration -Devs that engage with the community -Refrences Galore (If you like that kind of stuff)  Cons: -Can form an addiction quickly -Not explaining usefullness of fishing (Seriously .7% of players did 200 quests and only 3.4% did 25. The rewards are so worth it.) -Money being despawned easily in expert mode -Spending a ton of money to turn a good wearpon into s*** -The negative review section (Its all 'Minecraft Ripoff' and redirecting to positive')  Terraria is a good game and is something that if you're even remotely intrested in, it is worth trying. Just come with an open mind and don't expect 2D Minecraft, and a great community awaits you.  9/10 Would spend 10 minutes writing a serious review about a game that lets you be a werewolf on a unicorn shooting a gun shark fighting a robot worm while being surrounded by ufos, wearing wings, and beinmg followed by a puppy again.

"A one-man project that became a cult classic, Cave Story was recently brought to a wider audience through the efforts of Nicalis to reboot this phenomenal game. In doing so, they added several new play modes as well as updated graphics and sound. The core gameplay mechanics remain unchanged, however.  This is easily one of my favorite 2D platformers of all time, with solid mechanics, great music and an unmistakeable visual style. I could go on about technical details, but at the end of the day what sets Cave Story apart is that you can see the care that went into building it. Daisuke Amaya spent five years building every piece of the game by himself and the result is a labor of love that despite a few flaws here and there is very likely to win you over with its charm.  Nobody with even a passing interest in platformers or action adventures should pass this one up. Very few games on Steam offer the same bang for the buck.",1,oneman project became cult classic cave story recently brought wider audience efforts nicalis reboot phenomenal game added several new play modes well updated graphics sound core gameplay mechanics remain unchanged however easily one favorite platformers time solid mechanics great music unmistakeable visual style could go technical details end day sets cave story apart see care went building daisuke amaya spent five years building every piece game result labor love despite flaws likely win charm nobody even passing interest platformers action adventures pass one games steam offer bang buck

"Avadon: The Black Fortress is a fine modern RPG made in the old-school style. Except better: no swapping floppy disks or CDs! But it makes me a little sad to say that it feels like a chore to play.   Visually, Avadon exists in a 1995 timewarp: Better looking than the SSI 'Gold Box' D&amp;D RPGs, but not as nice as the Baldur's Gate era games from Bioware/Black Isle.   But Avadon isn't so concerned about appearances. What makes this old-looking game work in 2013 is how fluid the experience is. It looks dated, but it streamlines gameplay, and adds modern features like skill trees, and the ability to scale the game difficulty if you want to move more quickly through the game's difficult bits. And your character speeds around the screen! No more waiting as your party trudges around the map; this game respects your time, as your characters hustle around in loose formation.  But this fast game pace brings me to the part that I don't like. Avadon is big on prose, like RPGs used to be. Avadon makes up for its stick-figure graphics by providing rich, descriptive storytelling. There's a lot of reading to be done, and no voice acting. So far, so good.  But in Avadon, your character moves so quickly from encounter to encounter, you find yourself reading constantly. There's no break. It's like reading a book. Frankly, I find myself resenting how much reading this game is asking me to do. And I kept nodding off as I was playing.  Baldur's Gate was probably a 80 hour game. Avadon makes me wonder how much of that time was just trudging around on the screen, revealing the dark parts. Walking from place to place. The pace was slow, but maybe that was an intentional break from all the reading we were asked to do back then. Walk a little, fight a little, walk a little, read a little. In Avadon, it feels like read-run-read-run-read-run. So... much... reading.  I recommend Avadon, because I respect how fine of a job Spiderweb has done to streamline old game mechanics, while still maintaining a flavorful, old-school feeling. And the story's good! But bring your spectacles; you're going to be doing a lot of reading as you play.  On a related note, I recently purchased a pack of classic Bioware RPGs from  GOG.com .

Trust me in this. You can do so much things in this game - fight insane bosses, dig your way to the underworld, explore, loot, kill annoying slimes, pretty much anything you can think of.

The fun part does not end with the missions as you can always free roam in single player or join a multiplayer match and wreak havoc in your way.  Even though its expansions are a separate thing I cannot help myself and advice you to buy them as well. They add many cool missions and the most important aspect is that they intermingle with Niko's story.  I can only conclude by saying that Rockstar did an awesome job, as usual for a company so big. Hearing that they have ideas for 45 year to go I can only hope living to see GTA 20 years from now.",1,opinion game manages give lots unique thoroughly thought missions fun part end missions always free roam single player join multiplayer match wreak havoc way even though expansions separate thing cannot help advice buy well add many cool missions important aspect intermingle nikos story conclude saying rockstar awesome job usual company big hearing ideas year go hope living see gta years

"This game is pretty great. Don't play on Steam though, use the flash player. As a new player you might see level 20 as the ultimate goal. It really isn't. Maxing is.  Maxing: Your character has stats. Each of these stats can be increased by levelling up and drinking potions. However, since the max level is 20, you will (most likely) have to use potions to finish the job off. Learn more about potions  here  [www.realmeye.com] . Your stats cap out depending on your class. If you max out a stat, it will appear as a yellow number instead of a white one. People use ?/8 and #/8 to ask/answer/state anything about their character's stats. This is because there are a total of 8 stats to max.  Alright. Now you know that level 20 is totally nothing to be proud of, while walking around with an 8/8 is.

"Bastion exceeds all expectations of a smart action video game.  You play as the Kid, tasked with journeying to various locations (or basically, levels), fighting your way through enemies and reaching the end. And that's really the gist of it.  That may seem like a simple formula, and it is. But everything that comes along with the package: straight forward game play that challenges you with quick reaction times, customizable weapon choices and upgrades which supply strategy, various difficulty settings allowing you make this an extreme walk in the park or a warzone; all of this makes Bastion solid fun. Enemies try to surprise and outthink you with various forms, all of which have different weaknesses and strengths, keeping yourself constantly on your toes. While you fight your way through these places, you'll have to watch out for your health and limited number of special moves per level, which will decline with the various hazards and terrain that you may take for granted. And finally, bonus locations which supply challenges and rewards for your weapons, keeps the entire experience from getting boring.  And while the great game play may be what you go for, the game likewise ties in fantastic personality, art, music and story. The art really is something else and has its own feel to it, while the soundtrack has a rock and blues genre that is amazing and highly recommended to buy with the game. The story is also very well done and heavy, especially if you dig for it. Bastion rewards you with its story if you take the time to unlock certain achievements for back-story and histories concerning the characters. By the time I was done with the game I was blown away by the direction it had taken. This isn't just a story about an apocalypse and trying to fix it; by the time it was over, I knew the characters, what they were trying to do and why they were doing it. The ending is also one of the best I've experienced in a game, especially if the correct steps are taken to receive the best one.  I could continue to go on about this game, but I'll end the review here. In short, Bastion is a terrific action adventure that tells a rich story, shows beautiful art, gives a great soundtrack and leaves you with an unforgettable game. Great job, Supergiant Games, you're one of my indie favorites.

"I've poured over 100 hours into this masterpiece. Where do I start? The worlds and sprites are beautiful, the bosses are an amazing experience, and the game always gives you something new to play with. This game has so much content. There are 20+ ores and so many weapons, I couldn't even count them. The bosses are a terrifying masterpiece. From the mysterious Eye of Cthulu, to the towering Moon Lord, I could never say I hated a boss. Another thing I enjoy about this game is that you can be whatever you want. You can be a minigun-wielding killing machine who wears armor made of ores that are found in the depths of hell or a summoner who summons dragons using a click of a button.

I would agree that this is a hard game, it does not baby the player. There is no regenerating health, the enemy soldiers move quickly and have decent aim. I am not great at FPS games, but playing this game on medium is very enjoyable to me. The checkpoints are very well spaced. There are just enough health and armor packs.    If you are getting stuck in one spot I would suggest trying a different approach. Maybe even back up one checkpoint and come it things from a different angle. This is very different from the modern corridor shooters. The maps are enormous and you are free to go anywhere. I can see how this could be confusing for younger gamers used to COD style gameplay. Boats and trucks are an excellent strategy with their mounted guns. Stealth works very also. Early game with the M16 switching to single shot mode, going prone and headshots from a distance is another good method. Rushing in and spraying bullets will not work as well.   You will have ample ammo for your pistol and assault rifle, but much less for speciailzed weapons like the sniper rifle and rpg. This keeps things balanced and rewards the player for good planning.   Final comments on the difficulty. Everyone has different levels of skill. For me on he hardest difficulty levels I can not get very far without getting stuck. On medium the game is fun and I die maybe a couple times per level. Select the level appropriate for your abilities. Once you learn where the enemies are and how many that will give you an advantage.  Technologically this game is a masterpiece. Released 10 years and still looks great. It is the predecessor to Crysis. As for the story, who cares? It is a game not a movie. It is about the gameplay here. Cut scenes are few and far between and non disruptive. Nothing gets between you and pulling that trigger. There are no QTE's or moments where the game takes control away from you. It is a very pure experience.",1,reading negative reviews upset little seems two main complaints people game hard story somewhat lame would agree hard game baby player regenerating health enemy soldiers move quickly decent aim great fps games playing game medium enjoyable checkpoints well spaced enough health armor packs getting stuck one spot would suggest trying different approach maybe even back one checkpoint come things different angle different modern corridor shooters maps enormous free go anywhere see could confusing younger gamers used cod style gameplay boats trucks excellent strategy mounted guns stealth works also early game switching single shot mode going prone headshots distance another good method rushing spraying bullets work well ample ammo pistol assault rifle much less speciailzed weapons like sniper rifle rpg keeps things balanced rewards player good planning final comments difficulty everyone different levels skill hardest difficulty levels get far without getting stuck medium game fun die maybe couple times per level select level appropriate abilities learn enemies many give advantage technologically game masterpiece released years still looks great predecessor crysis story cares game movie gameplay cut scenes far non disruptive nothing gets pulling trigger qtes moments game takes control away pure experience

Apart from the story, they added some things like counter attack, using dropped weapons from enemies etc. They also messed up controls. Blocking is gone and you can only dodge now with the right analog stick. The old blocking button is pounce now and you can pounce fat enemies too. They added more epic soundtracks and animations but I still prefer first one's animations. They also added 'Survival Mode' and you can play online co-op, too.

"Bully aka Canis Canem Edit, I First played it in 2006 when I was 8 and I still play it till this day.  It's one of my favourite games of all time. A lot of people call this a GTA type game without as much violence and I would sort of agree to some extent. You cannot steal cars or shoot guns, weapons vary, you can use for example a slingshot or firecrackers, my favourite is the spud gun.  Travelling is not bad nor good, you can get around on either your Vespa Scooter, Skateboard or bikes. going to classes in this game is actually fun, my favorite is music and shop,  in shop for example you work on bikes and if you get the bike fixed you get to keep it so instead of buying bikes you can unlock them. The community for this game is great, people still make mods for this game which is fun for doing playthroughs. One of my favorite things about this game is the background music/score.  Rockstar Games did a really good job and it fits the game perfectly.  Story in this game is interesting, the opening cutscene explains why Jimmy is at this school so I won't spoil anything or say anything else.   Tl;dr,, 1 of my fav games of all time, sfw gta type gameplay. good story and music/background score.

Anyone who knows me knows that I am a huge sucker for real stealth gameplay. There are different types of stealth and the kind that I hunger for is actually rare these days. Most games have stealth as an option but I never see it as the only way to progress. Options are nice but I love it when the game punishes you for being spotted. Forget about shooting your way through. Guns are literally only used to take out lights. Anything else is a travesty. Hardcore stealth like this is very few and fare between. Which is why Splinter Cell is one of my favorite game series. So much nostalgia sneaking past guards in very dark places. Using your wits and the shadows to sneak by. Hell some missions flat out failed you if your spotted and why the ♥♥♥♥ not when the entire premise is that you weren't supposed to be there. Taking out a single guard requires timing and strategy as just taking him out isn't enough. Finding a good place to hide his body is critical. Hell some missions were so strict that taking out anyone was mission failure. I cannot stress enough how much I love it! The earlier SC games were a treasure that I will always love. Sad that Pandora Tomorrow isn't on steam because without that we have to skip to Chaos Theory and after that things will never be the same for this series. This game is really showing its age but it still holds up really well.,1,anyone knows knows huge sucker real stealth gameplay different types stealth kind hunger actually rare days games stealth option never see way progress options nice love game punishes spotted forget shooting way guns literally used take lights anything else travesty hardcore stealth like fare splinter cell one favorite game series much nostalgia sneaking past guards dark places using wits shadows sneak hell missions flat failed spotted entire premise werent supposed taking single guard requires timing strategy taking isnt enough finding good place hide body critical hell missions strict taking anyone mission failure cannot stress enough much love earlier sc games treasure always love sad pandora tomorrow isnt steam without skip chaos theory things never series game really showing age still holds really well

"XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a great, modern version of a cult-classic from the '90s. The earth is getting attacked by an alien invasion. The nations of the world found the XCOM to deal with the invaders - and you are the commander.  The gameplay is divided into two parts - the strategic base building game, were you deal with developing new weapons, deciding what countries to protect with satelite surveillance or shooting down UFOs. The other part is the tactic mode - you send a squad of 4-6 elite soldiers to deal with the invaders. Turn based you move carefully, kill some invaders and try to take prisoners for further interrogation. Your soldiers progress in an RPG like manner in four classes: Storm, Heavy, Support and Snipers. Be carefull who you move first - one wrong move can kill a soldier you invested hours in.  XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a game of decissions - do you buy a laser weapon or the better armor? When multiple cities get attacked at once - you have to decide which to defend, risking the other city and nation to get lost on you forever.   You are the only chance for earth to repel the invasion. Use it - and have fun in a game I already spend 50 hours in.",1,xcom enemy unknown great modern version cultclassic earth getting attacked alien invasion nations world found xcom deal invaders commander gameplay divided two parts strategic base building game deal developing new weapons deciding countries protect satelite surveillance shooting ufos part tactic mode send squad elite soldiers deal invaders turn based move carefully kill invaders try take prisoners interrogation soldiers progress rpg like manner four classes storm heavy support snipers carefull move first one wrong move kill soldier invested hours xcom enemy unknown game decissions buy laser weapon better armor multiple cities get attacked decide defend risking city nation get lost forever chance earth repel invasion use fun game already spend hours

"This game is so much fun. I first heard about Terraria from one of my friends when he got a copy for the XBOX360 (or maybe it was the PS3, it was over a year ago when I last saw him play it) and I ended up looking to see if it was available on Android since I didn't have a decent computer, and I loved it on that! It was fun, but the only problem with that version is I never could figure out how to use the beds on my phone. Then when I finally got a Steam card and a better laptop, I immediately bought this. I also recommended this to my brother and it was the only thing he would play on his phone. He said it's kind of like Zelda meets Final Fantasy meets Minecraft and in my opinion, it is. Still, amazing game, only complaint is that it's better than minecraft besides the fact it doesn't have a 'creative' mode like Minecraft. I think it'd be even better if Terraria had that feature added, but if it isn't, that's fine. It's still really fun!",1,game much fun first heard terraria one friends got copy xbox maybe ps year ago last saw play ended looking see available android since didnt decent computer loved fun problem version never could figure use beds phone finally got steam card better laptop immediately bought also recommended brother thing would play phone said kind like zelda meets final fantasy meets minecraft opinion still amazing game complaint better minecraft besides fact doesnt creative mode like minecraft think itd even better terraria feature added isnt thats fine still really fun

"This game is a hoot.  Really though I have to say Owlboy is one of the best-looking games on Steam. Right from the get-go I could see all the painstaking detail that went into this game to make it as gorgeous as it is, from the charming character expressions to the environments that really draw you into the world of the game. Aside from beholding the magnificent visuals, the game itself is a lot of fun! Keep in mind I went into this without any expectations and found myself surprised at the quality of the puzzles and level design. Oh, and the MUSIC is so vibrant and does an amazing job at reflecting the tone of the game through it's various stages.

"What is Killing Floor, you ask? British People vs Zombies: The game. Complete with Dosh, Heavy Metal, more stereotypical Brits than a Monty Python sketch, and over 32 of some of the beefiest, most satisfying Zed-killing weapons you'll encounter in a video game. There's even 'Loadsamoney' himself, Mr Harry Einfeld, present and accounted for to wreck the Zed menace.   This is a game where you need to play on a difficulty higher than 'beginner' to experience. The fun of this game comes from it's challenge, and while I can understand people liking their games as easy, simple fun, the real 'survival horror' elements of this game come out when you're up against tougher enemies. I personally don't find this game scary due to the undertone silliness from all the characters models and event Zeds, but I still have a lot of fun with this game.  Despite coming out back in 2009, Tripwire Interactive have been supporting this game for the last 4 years, and with each update, event and DLC pack they've added, the game's got better and better!   So go ahead and pick up a copy of this now! Hell, get the 'bundle' copy which contains 90% of the game's DLC for only slightly more (trust me, most of it may be character models, but by god are they worth it).

"I loveddd this game to death, and it still remains one of my favorite games if not my favorite GTA. It's one of the first games I sunk over 100 hours into, and even more so with the many user mods released over the last decade or so, including two multiplayer ones and the CLEO mods. I figured I'd grab it on Steam a couple years back for convenience instead of continuing to use my scratched up disc copy. But a recent major patch for this game actually strips away content rather than add any. It has removed 1920x1080 support, 17 songs from the great soundtrack (most likely because of expired royalty/copyright), and replaces most of original menu/HUD with the mobile version similar to the recent Android/iOS releases of this game. You can find the full list of changes elsewhere.

"Massive lack of information on how to play this game. No tutorial to start with which makes the whole process very frustrating.

Even if you kill all the enemies on the screen just to give yourself a breather, 8 more show up within about 5 seconds. So all in all, a terrible experience.  On the service, the 8-bit graphics convey a simple pick-up-and-play to figure things out, but so far this is not true. I will continue to give this game a shot as it has been very popular.

"It was fun at first, but it grew old quickly. I purchased due to Atlis Life mod, and quickly found the lack of players willing to comply with server rules, made the game not so enjoyable. The large maps are nice and all, but too damn big for 100 or less people... I enjoy the realist consideration of the game, such as fatigue from sprinting, and its effect on aiming.   Overall, ARMA 3 does not have a lasting effect on me. Some of the situations that occur are very fun, and memorable, but I often find myself logged in, running around in circles doing nothing. For large scale combat (meaning hundreds of players at the same time, in the same location), on maps the size of Arma 3 maps, I would recommend Planetside 2, which is a free-to-play game. The simulation ARMA 3 offers is extremely impressive, and quenches my thirst of rendering 360 No-Scope Headshot noobs useless.

"Kind of a mixed bag is this one. Played it for the first time and after playing Crysis 2 i must say they definitly made improvements from the original. For starters the game looks great. You can immediatly tell why this was a PC Breaking game back in 2011. Graphics with water, fog, and lighting are amazing to look at and the environments are varied and exciting. Gameplay is where is seems to be the jumble of good and bad. The combat is tight and responds well however the driving is crap and the flight missions downright stupid. The waypoints system works at times but in others i found myself running around looking for the right path to take in the later levels. sometimes there was absolutly no direction unless I opened my objectives tab and read the fine print. NOW we hit the big problem with this game. The difficulty spikes are incredibly crushing to the point of infuriation. Cheap ♥♥♥ deaths from instant killing enemies that you cant see are increasingly frustrating especially when you have the suits armor on and at full health.

"I had this game on the PlayStation3 and it was kinda enjoyable. Ripping and tearing apart innocent citizens and soldiers alike, destroying everything, ellbow-slamming a tank - there will be gore and explosions everywhere. Sounds decent, right?  A little.  Only problem is the controls where a bit clunky (even on the PS3) and I had massive problems focussing and attacking the enemy I actually wanted. Another funbreaker is the fact that you're easily being bounced back, even by small and weak enemies. It's even worse when stronger enemies and helicopters chase you. Sometimes you're feeling like a ball in a pinball machine.  This game has so much potential and with proper implementation this propably would have been the best anti-aggression-game and there is. I mean, you have all those amazing powers! From disguise to running at super speed to hammerfists (lets you smash tanks), clawhands (rips and tears everything apart), whiplash (for taking down distant enemies), superjumping, semi-flying (gliding). You can even throw buses into helicopters and stuff, the list goes on and it's awesome.  But you're almost not able to live it up.  The story is ok and acceptable. The missions are way too hard and not fun at all (I'm not a good gamer, though). In one mission you have to flee. Excuse me? I'm a godlike creature and can destroy a tank with a single blow with my ellbow, why the heck should I flee?  That's boring and uninspiring. It's like getting a Lamborghini in a racing game and the game tells you to drive not faster than 30 miles per hour. Unfortunately, I didn't find any cheats or mods for this game. I think with a little effort like removing all the time based missions and the bouncing this would be just awesome.  If you can get this game for a decent price (it's under 10 dollars mostly, on Humble Bundle even cheaper) and if you do like gore, GO GET IT and happy ripping and tearing bodies apart for a while. I really hope you could do an devastator attack on some people out there who are wasting so much potential. It hurts, especially as a creative person.",-1,game playstation kinda enjoyable ripping tearing apart innocent citizens soldiers alike destroying everything ellbowslamming tank gore explosions everywhere sounds decent right little problem controls bit clunky even ps massive problems focussing attacking enemy actually wanted another funbreaker fact youre easily bounced back even small weak enemies even worse stronger enemies helicopters chase sometimes youre feeling like ball pinball machine game much potential proper implementation propably would best antiaggressiongame mean amazing powers disguise running super speed hammerfists lets smash tanks clawhands rips tears everything apart whiplash taking distant enemies superjumping semiflying gliding even throw buses helicopters stuff list goes awesome youre almost able live story ok acceptable missions way hard fun im good gamer though one mission flee excuse im godlike creature destroy tank single blow ellbow heck flee thats boring uninspiring like getting lamborghini racing game game tells drive faster miles per hour unfortunately didnt find cheats mods game think little effort like removing time based missions bouncing would awesome get game decent price dollars mostly humble bundle even cheaper like gore go get happy ripping tearing bodies apart really hope could devastator attack people wasting much potential hurts especially creative person

"Hmmm, this is a game everybody loves, right?  I absolutely recognize the greatness of this game, and I understand why so many love it. But it is not a game for me. I also did not finish it. I just did not have the time and strength to do so. So, I'm probably missing a lot. But I did spend a fair time with it, and I think I got the core gameplay enough to give it a review. This is supposed to be the king of open world games, and I can see that. But personally, there are other open world games I enjoy more, like sleeping dogs for example.  What is great? Graphics, presentation, story, voice acting, so many possibilities and activities. Music and radio is great and funny. Vehicles handles well. The city is immense and 'beautiful'. The city feels alive. The level of detail. Every part of the game is well made. The atmosphere is well presented. The game plays well with a mouse and keyboard, even though I think it is made for a controller.  What is not so great? Well, There is nothing really wrong with the game per se, I just did not like it, and I found it frustrating. You need quite a good PC to really appreciate what the game can offer you, or the game will feel sluggish.  I personally had enough of the crudeness of the game. I am not against violent games, I just had enough of it in the end, and did not find it that great to just destroy everything. I thought the characters too horrible to deal with. I do recognize that the story is written like that, with a lot of satire and sarcasm, and it does it really well. I just don't care for it. And after playing for a while, it just left me with a bad taste. I don't think these games are bad for anyone, or that they promote violence. I just don't enjoy this stuff, and I found it repetitive. It was particularly frustrating to try a mission over and over (if I found it difficult) because going back to that mission ment you had to start over somewhere else, and then drive there. It just became tedious.  Again, most people really like this, and the game is clearly a masterpiece, but not something that suits me. If you like chaos, playing with a big playground, doing things that you are not allowed in real life, this might give you a good outlet, with quite a few laughs as well.  Still, I prefer 'just cause 2'. I do think that GTA IV accomplishes more, and the games are quite different, but the style and humour fits me better in that game, if we are talking about open world chaos games. Just Cause 2 runs better, feels less frustrating, and feels less complicated.

"I though after reading a few reviews I would try this game. Racing games are my preferred area and the open world does make it more enjoyable. I do like the free roam aspect and the world does feel very open and available to explore, however that is only part of the game. Once I started playing the campaign it became a very different story. I setup my campaign on normal thinking that the missions would be pretty basic pursuits and escorts. I was wrong. The missions don’t seem to have much set direction, such as you can go one route on one play and a different route on another play. Now yes this may sound like 'well that’s cool it keeps you on the edge.' and it would be that way except most events have a distance bar that if the target gets farther than 200m away you lose the event. so when you’re on the highway and the suspect takes an unexpected exit yes you may be able to break quickly and stop just after the exit but by the time you turn around and get going again you’ve already lost the event. I would give the game a 3.5 out of 5, the open world aspect is good and the driving and drive physics are good and do make driving enjoyable. However, the fact that even on normal the campaign is difficult and frustrating it makes enjoying the game difficult, you can’t get new cars without beating campaign events so you are pretty much forced to play the events over and over again. I do like the game but I wouldn’t recommend it, I only paid 2.50 for it so I'm not disappointed in it but I feel if you paid full price you may be.",-1,though reading reviews would try game racing games preferred area open world make enjoyable like free roam aspect world feel open available explore however part game started playing campaign became different story setup campaign normal thinking missions would pretty basic pursuits escorts wrong missions dont seem much set direction go one route one play different route another play yes may sound like well thats cool keeps edge would way except events distance bar target gets farther away lose event youre highway suspect takes unexpected exit yes may able break quickly stop exit time turn around get going youve already lost event would give game open world aspect good driving drive physics good make driving enjoyable however fact even normal campaign difficult frustrating makes enjoying game difficult cant get new cars without beating campaign events pretty much forced play events like game wouldnt recommend paid im disappointed feel paid full price may

"First of all compliments to the great game engine. Its shooting physics and gun play are very well done. The campaign plays just like Half-Life 2, with the story being told in the same way. Only difference is that there's random hallucinations mixed in at appropriate times. These are very well-done and although not scary, they create a great, mysterious atmosphere. The biggest disappointment is that there are no ranked multiplayer matches (2011), with only 1 or 2 unranked servers online at any given time. It's a shame since the multiplayer has potential to be fun and perhaps more polished than F.E.A.R. Combat's. The story is short with a lack of varied environments and gameplay. However, what you do get is of fairly decent quality and there's nothing like it out there. I played the demo on Xbox 360 and on PC before purchasing and it's quite clear that this game was made for the PC judging by the wealth of buttons in this game. Overall it's a decent game but not good value for money.",-1,first compliments great game engine shooting physics gun play well done campaign plays like halflife story told way difference theres random hallucinations mixed appropriate times welldone although scary create great mysterious atmosphere biggest disappointment ranked multiplayer matches unranked servers online given time shame since multiplayer potential fun perhaps polished fear combats story short lack varied environments gameplay however get fairly decent quality theres nothing like played demo xbox pc purchasing quite clear game made pc judging wealth buttons game overall decent game good value money

I can't recommend this game unfortunately. It has some novel game design ideas and the art style is fantastic 50s classic sifi.  Unfortunately the levels are basically puzzles where you have to figure out exactly what combination of units you are expected to buy and deploy. Stray from the 'correct' formula and the levels are pretty much impossible to win. This takes all the creativity and tactical freedom out of the game which makes it go very boring very fast.,-1,cant recommend game unfortunately novel game design ideas art style fantastic classic sifi unfortunately levels basically puzzles figure exactly combination units expected buy deploy stray correct formula levels pretty much impossible win takes creativity tactical freedom game makes go boring fast

"Before reading please note,  THIS REVIEW IS OF THE DLC, NOT THE GAME . Now that that's out of the way...  Okay, here's the deal. I love Spore. Like, a LOT. So, when it went on sale a while back, I decided to re-buy it (I owned the disc version, but lost the code, so I basically didn't own it). DLC was only like, $5, and I played Galactic Adventures (I loved it, but that's a review for ANOTHER day). Honestly, it was hardly worth the $5.  So if you don't know, the Creepy &amp; Cute pack adds some new creature parts and patterns, but that's it. The arms and legs are literally all bug parts, so nothing I want to use there, some cool new other bits, though. For patterns, some feel 'Creepy' like one pattern that looks kind of like muscles, and not so much cute (though it does add a feather pattern, sort of, which is awesome because I love building birds in this game). It doesn't really add too many parts, and quite a few of them feel like they should be part of the game already.  The other problem is that it only adds CREATURE parts. No new clothes, no building, no new anything. Also, the new animations are only in the test drive mode. They're cool to watch, but would be even cooler to see in game. Oh, and another thing that bothers me (But isn't a deal breaker by any means) is the fact that because of how the expansions worked pre-steam, Steam tracks my hours while playing Creepy &amp; Cute, but not the actual game, which means I have to play without my extra parts if I want steam trading cards.  Overall, don't waste $20 on this expansion. If you have $20 burning a hole in your wallet, and you already own Spore, try out Galactic Adventures. It's pretty awesome, if I do say so myself (owned the Expansion for Disc, so yeah. I plan on getting it on a sale or something).  TL;DR: Doesn't really add a whole lot. Not worth $20, though might be worth it if it's on sale.  Don't forget,  THIS IS REVIEW OF THE DLC, NOT THE GAME.  I love Spore, man!

"Buy this if you think Microsoft Excel is too exciting for you.  Seriously, very sorry to say, but I think it's an absolutely horrendous game. Zero excitement. Zero. Bad graphics (worse than many cell phones today). Zero thrill. Insanely boring.   Gameplay goes like this:  -&gt; you walk (more like slowly inching your way) off a 'building'  -&gt; you 'fall' (more like slowly drift) towards something supposed to be downwards  -&gt; you steer clear of stuff (big blocks/pixels) on your way down, and try to hit various targets on the way down etc.  -&gt; you deploy your 'chute' (which is stated to be a helicopter-thingy?) and land  -&gt; repeat ad naseum.  No render of a ground or imminent dangers. Just blocks and stuff magically hovering in mid-air on your way down. No resemblance to an actual base-jump, or parachute-jump for that matter, whatsoever. You can unlock different places to 'jump'.   Why not make it go fast, like a real jump? Why not add the whooshing sound of air, or add the instability from the air resistance that rushing towards the ground gives you? Why no content or graphics? Why doesn't anything look like real buildings, or real persons, or anything real?

"A regular 2D beat em up game so awkwardly balanced it's barely playable. The game is hard, but it is super tedious to get through. The first few levels are fun until the overpowered bosses get a hold of you. I would not have a problem with this if the bosses were programmed to be as strong as me and as good as me. But they are so strong I got bored mid fight. For a fast paced action game to be like this really takes away a lot of enjoyment out of the game.   A boss fight should not be about how long you punch the guy but about how much skill it takes to land the punches. I won't even go into detail about checkpoints, whoever designed and placed them clearly had no idea what they were doing. Why? Just why? For hardcore mode going to the beginning of the level is no big deal, or even mid level. But to have it even on normal is just overkill.  Play if you enjoy small burst of enjoyment and bosses with infinitely health.

"  Pros      There's a big world for you to explore.    The clue solving and lie dector gameplay is entertaining    The street crime (minigames?) are really fun    It tells good stories (I'm not sure if there is an over-arching plot)      Cons       While the world is big, there is  NOTHING  to do outside of the main objective and street crimes.     The lie dector gameplay is broken and gets stale fast.   you can click lie for everything, it will go through a scripted sequence, and if you're wrong, you simpily take the statement back.   Also I couldn't tell the answer 99% of the time just based on their face.     There are a few street crimes and they get looped after a while (I liked them, but after the 100th time they're no fun)     You only get your gun in (some) street crimes (and maybe a few missions)     The characters aren't fleshed out enough (Partners are jerks that have no real purpose and switch after a few missions. The main character has no real background story   with the exception of the war flashbacks that happen inbetween missions  )     The controls are slippery (cars feel like they have butter under the tires and the character movement is awful in a way I cannot explain).    OVERALL   L.A. Noire is an interesting game that is fun, but only for a few hours. I can only recommend it if it goes on sale for $5 or if you're a real fan of 1950s(?) detective games.

"Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with this game, it's just difficult to recommend.  Team Fortress Classic is a frantic, but durable shooter. It requires a lot more movement and percision when compared to it's successor, TF2. The problem is, it's a bit too unbalanced in difficulty. Defending teams have a bit too much of an advantage, and the maps don't neccessarily suffice for both teams either. One side always has an advantage, and it doesn't help when teams are unbalanced due to the lack of players.  The good thing is, combat still holds up today. New players will be familiar with the weapons, as most of them are similiar in control to their TF2 variants. If one is proficient at TF2, then the Classic classes shouldn't require too much struggle to master. Classic is definitely satisfying and exhilirating, especially when you assign the controls to your preferences.   Aside from combat, not much else holds up honestly in Team Fortress Classic. It's fun, there's no doubt, but there's nothing here begging for a purchase. It doesn't hold up like Half-Life does, and it doesn't really hold the strong community needed to support dedicated play. Servers are generally sporadic, and the FoxBot mods only give you so much of an experience.  The Verdict:  Team Fortress Classic holds up well in gameplay, but the declining amount of players have diminished so much of the possibilities within the game. Many modes and mods have become obsolete, with only a few such as 'Capture the Flag' surviving.  Honestly, only buy Team Fortress Classic if you are a big fan of early 3D shooters like Quake or Doom. If you enjoy those games, Classic will be right up your ally. Just beware of an abundance of vacant servers.  (EDIT: 3 thumbs down? C'mon people, don't be so biased. I was honest and said the game was good, but after being so outdated it's only accessible to certain audiences.)",-1,dont get wrong nothing wrong game difficult recommend team fortress classic frantic durable shooter requires lot movement percision compared successor tf problem bit unbalanced difficulty defending teams bit much advantage maps dont neccessarily suffice teams either one side always advantage doesnt help teams unbalanced due lack players good thing combat still holds today new players familiar weapons similiar control tf variants one proficient tf classic classes shouldnt require much struggle master classic definitely satisfying exhilirating especially assign controls preferences aside combat much else holds honestly team fortress classic fun theres doubt theres nothing begging purchase doesnt hold like halflife doesnt really hold strong community needed support dedicated play servers generally sporadic foxbot mods give much experience verdict team fortress classic holds well gameplay declining amount players diminished much possibilities within game many modes mods become obsolete capture flag surviving honestly buy team fortress classic big fan early shooters like quake doom enjoy games classic right ally beware abundance vacant servers edit thumbs cmon people dont biased honest said game good outdated accessible certain audiences

"I'll keep this short. I've been playing Fallen Earth for a few years, mostly using the standalone game, but recently through Steam. I have maybe 500 hours total on Fallen Earth. The game has only gotten worse over time and I can't recommend it to new players.  The same bugs that have always existed still exist, the animations and visuals aren't very good, it's very poorly optimized and takes pretty decent hardware to make it run acceptably, and instead of creating further incentive to buy content and become a subscriber, they just make it more difficult to play for free. A prime example of this is the semi-recent gimp to the crafting system. The developers up and limited the crafting qeue to one item for free players. One. Keep in mind this is a game heavily focused on crafting. It now takes exponentially longer to craft large things like vehicles and weapons that take multiple parts, because you constantly have to go back and add new items to the qeue. This was supposed to be incentive to pay for the game, but at least for me it just made me stop playing. I came back and started playing again recently and it's just as bad as ever.  The game simply isn't fun. It's a half-finished mess that more hassle than it's worth if you're playing for free. In my opinion, Fallen Earth is a prime example of F2P games done wrong. The developers don't care about the players, or improving the game. There are a ton of things they could have done over the years to improve the game and make it more attractive to paying players, but instead they've decided to just leave the game glitchy and half-♥♥♥♥♥ and instead draw in paying players by making it too ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to play for free.

And they don't give actual instructions. I just spawned a tiny little smart car and started driving around in the City crashing into other players. This game is a pile of donkey ♥♥♥♥. Don't even think about getting it. This is basically GTA's little autistic midget albino baby who is blind.  My friend recommended this game to me.

"This game looked so fun, I love platforming/parkour type games and thought that having it in First-person would be awesome. I know too that many have enjoyed it, plus we gotta support new types of games since EA was nice enough to allow this game to be made. But as I played it I found it get more aggrivating as I played and then it became frustrating at around the middle of it.  This Game is plagued by poor collision detection, and frustrating forced combat, it feels like the developers didn't know basic game design. First lets talk about the platforming, despite being a linear progression game there is many times where you will not know where to go, there is a button that tells you, but it only tells you where you will ultimately end up, even if its in the opposite direction you have to go. This is supposed to not be a problem thanks to the artstyle being mostly consisting of white with clearly contrasted colors. This is a good design, but it is not done well as there is colors that don't matter, only red tells you where to go, but there is also red objects in the enviroment that are not useful and are there for the same reason as every color: aesthetic. The only red items that are useful only turn red when nearby, this means you have to be heading to it anyways, and sometimes it doesn't load the red fast enough and you might pass it, this wouldn't be a problem if it was always red. In fact I've encountered items that weren't turning red and were vital to progress.(not to mention that sometimes even when you know where you need to go, the main can't seem to jump this gap, and even went THROUGH a red pipe and fell to her death multiple times in a row! And I had already proven it could be grabbed!) They should've made a consistent color scheme where every color was used to help you progress, red items are things to jump off and climb (as it is now), blue walls would mean follow along/run on this wall, and green walls mean go up/climb up this wall.  The combat can be circumvented at times, which is nice. But theres so many sections that you're being shot at, and the only way to take down people is to run up to them since you only have your hands to fight, so the enemy just stands there shooting you and you just gotta hope they don't kill you first. The fighting for me is not fun, and not fluid or interesting. And several sections you have to fight, which means: make it to an enemy and knock them out, grab there gun and then it becomes a generic run-and-gun game. One section I tried countless times to run past and couldn't figure out where to go, I knew I had to leave through the front door, except the only turning-door of this mall was blocked by a crashed police car, so I killed everyone in the room and used a gun to shoot out the glass around the door which I done in previous levels, except this glass was bulletproof, so after tons of deaths and looking around I find you have to actually try to go through this blocked off entrance and the level wouldn't end until you were actually in the turnstyle door.  Overall, and I'm sure I missed something (the story isn't really worth writing about, its okay) but I could not recommend buying it unless you already tried it and like it, so rent first if possible. But really with a sequel on the way just try that one instead, it'll hopefully be improved.",-1,game looked fun love platformingparkour type games thought firstperson would awesome know many enjoyed plus gotta support new types games since ea nice enough allow game made played found get aggrivating played became frustrating around middle game plagued poor collision detection frustrating forced combat feels like developers didnt know basic game design first lets talk platforming despite linear progression game many times know go button tells tells ultimately end even opposite direction go supposed problem thanks artstyle mostly consisting white clearly contrasted colors good design done well colors dont matter red tells go also red objects enviroment useful reason every color aesthetic red items useful turn red nearby means heading anyways sometimes doesnt load red fast enough might pass wouldnt problem always red fact ive encountered items werent turning red vital progressnot mention sometimes even know need go main cant seem jump gap even went red pipe fell death multiple times row already proven could grabbed shouldve made consistent color scheme every color used help progress red items things jump climb blue walls would mean follow alongrun wall green walls mean go upclimb wall combat circumvented times nice theres many sections youre shot way take people run since hands fight enemy stands shooting gotta hope dont kill first fighting fun fluid interesting several sections fight means make enemy knock grab gun becomes generic runandgun game one section tried countless times run past couldnt figure go knew leave front door except turningdoor mall blocked crashed police car killed everyone room used gun shoot glass around door done previous levels except glass bulletproof tons deaths looking around find actually try go blocked entrance level wouldnt end actually turnstyle door overall im sure missed something story isnt really worth writing okay could recommend buying unless already tried like rent first possible really sequel way try one instead itll hopefully improved
"I played the first two hours of this and it was simply way too easy, no challenge at all. Therefore it lost all fun. Maybe the game just progresses too slowly, but that itself would be a problem as well.",-1,played first two hours simply way easy challenge therefore lost fun maybe game progresses slowly would problem well
"The Demo was working perfectly, but the game refuses to start after I bought the full version. There are fixes for: 'A DDraw object has a non-zero reference count (meaning it was not properly cleaned up).' but unfortunately, none of them worked for me. I have no doubt that this is a pretty good game (since the demo convinced me of buying the full game, obviously), but right now, I can't recommend it, simply because it isn't working anymore.  Edit: I know that people don't like it, when reviews are negative, because the game didn't run for the reviewer, but that's just how it is. And if a game isn't running, even after you applied the fixes for it, nobody can recommend a game. Simple as that.",-1,demo working perfectly game refuses start bought full version fixes ddraw object nonzero reference count meaning properly cleaned unfortunately none worked doubt pretty good game since demo convinced buying full game obviously right cant recommend simply isnt working anymore edit know people dont like reviews negative game didnt run reviewer thats game isnt running even applied fixes nobody recommend game simple

"This game has a lot of interesting stuff in it, but lags with seemingly no reason at random points, and the movement is some of the worst I've seen in a video game. Also if you don't have the dlc which is like 30 dollars, whenever you sit in a car that belongs to the dlc it flashes advertisements all over your screen, I know I don't have the dlc but that's a pretty bad. Whenever you try to play multiplayer it goes through like 4 different loading screens. About the movement, the player moves like they are both very fatigued and has heavily weathered prothstetic legs, I can see that they were going for realism but it's not done very well at all. You also have to uninstall your mods to play on a server that doesn't have your specific set of mods Also you cannot jump.  Cool Stuff: Minor character customization Good graphics Prone Rolling Ability to lean  Lots of options When the game isn't having a stroke it runs pretty smoothly Lots of equipment, but half of it is for the dlc You can do a vault which is functionally is just a slow, small jump. Mods Fun with buddies   This game can be pretty fun sometimes but I don't think it's worth the full price and you should wait for a sale to get it. If you don't have a lot of money to spare then don't buy this game because the dlc hungers.",-1,game lot interesting stuff lags seemingly reason random points movement worst ive seen video game also dont dlc like dollars whenever sit car belongs dlc flashes advertisements screen know dont dlc thats pretty bad whenever try play multiplayer goes like different loading screens movement player moves like fatigued heavily weathered prothstetic legs see going realism done well also uninstall mods play server doesnt specific set mods also cannot jump cool stuff minor character customization good graphics prone rolling ability lean lots options game isnt stroke runs pretty smoothly lots equipment half dlc vault functionally slow small jump mods fun buddies game pretty fun sometimes dont think worth full price wait sale get dont lot money spare dont buy game dlc hungers
