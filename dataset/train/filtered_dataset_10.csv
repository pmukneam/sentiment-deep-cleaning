Nice little throw back for zombies especially since the maps are modded. I recommend getting it cheaper somewhere else though.,1,nice little throw back zombies especially since maps modded recommend getting cheaper somewhere else though

"Found the game through a humble bundle sale, and was instantly a fan of the studio after playing this game. The art is amazing it shows amazing detail to the little things that help the ambience as well as beautiful to look at the full picture, and perfectly sets the mood for each location. The soundtrack sets the atmosphere with even more depth. The gameplay is pretty solid with a good selection of weapons and an addicting battle system that is simple enough to get the hang of, but complicated enough to master as well as keeps your attention at the battle at hand. If there is something to look out for while playing though is the battle system does punish for mistakes and takes a while to get use to if you do not tend to play games of these types.",1,found game humble bundle sale instantly fan studio playing game art amazing shows amazing detail little things help ambience well beautiful look full picture perfectly sets mood location soundtrack sets atmosphere even depth gameplay pretty solid good selection weapons addicting battle system simple enough get hang complicated enough master well keeps attention battle hand something look playing though battle system punish mistakes takes get use tend play games types

"Well, I've played this game countless of times, but here I am, after buying this game on Steam. What can I say, every minute spent on playing it is a tremendous adventure. Breathtaking graphics, and immeasurable world packed with lots of quests. Crafting, on which most of us spent a lot of time, spells and skils, and last, but not least extremely well paired music.  I'm glad that I've decided buying it, so again I can experience Amalur's story.  I strongly recommend it to everyone, enjoy!",1,well ive played game countless times buying game steam say every minute spent playing tremendous adventure breathtaking graphics immeasurable world packed lots quests crafting us spent lot time spells skils last least extremely well paired music im glad ive decided buying experience amalurs story strongly recommend everyone enjoy

"This... this is a game... a really really bad one. I honestly think it could have been something that could have been kind of funny but... instead they decided to make as many sexual puns as they could. So many in fact that I don't even think a 10 year old who just discovered what this dangly thing in between his legs are, would cringe while playing this game. The gameplay... is way o forgiving, there is a death counter but it doesn't matter because no matter where you die there is no punishment you spawn literally right where you died with full health. Honestly dying is a Pro Tip I give for you 'MLG' gamers out there. Bottom line this game is horrible, the music assualts your ears the gameplay is horrible and THE JOKES OHHH GOD!  1/10  10/10 IGN",-1,game really really bad one honestly think could something could kind funny instead decided make many sexual puns could many fact dont even think year old discovered dangly thing legs would cringe playing game gameplay way forgiving death counter doesnt matter matter die punishment spawn literally right died full health honestly dying pro tip give mlg gamers bottom line game horrible music assualts ears gameplay horrible jokes ohhh god ign
"An hour in, and I realize that Ubi did not stray far in these past years. This more or less plays like a very clunky Assassin's Creed, probably because its old and because Ubi decided to just focus excessively on that formula in its games that came after. I'm only an hour in and I'm not sure how much I care to finish it, discovering that. A few people have told me that its a great game but it's going to be hard to enjoy the early iteration of a game whose design I have already played enough of without seeing any real innovation.",-1,hour realize ubi stray far past years less plays like clunky assassins creed probably old ubi decided focus excessively formula games came im hour im sure much care finish discovering people told great game going hard enjoy early iteration game whose design already played enough without seeing real innovation
