"Yeah I recommend this game! Why? Well, because it is a great racing game, of the best. Considering that most programmers from the TOCA development team worked on this game, they succeed to create an immersive racing feeling. It may not be a full simulator, but it really sent you on the track. Cockpit view, bro, that's specifically awesome about it. Still having fun online, but using Gameranger.  TL:DR version: Buy the game, is freaking awesome.",1,yeah recommend game well great racing game best considering programmers toca development team worked game succeed create immersive racing feeling may full simulator really sent track cockpit view bro thats specifically awesome still fun online using gameranger tldr version buy game freaking awesome

"Worms 2 in 1997 was my introduction to this series, and while I still say that the best one was Worms World Party, I will say that Worms Reloaded is a decent successor. I never liked the 3D worms games but this one is similar to the current generation of Street Fighter games where everything is fully 3D with a 2D perspective. There are a lot of interesting mechanics in this new version that I enjoy so it gets my stamp of approval. Grab it on a sale and enjoy.",1,worms introduction series still say best one worms world party say worms reloaded decent successor never liked worms games one similar current generation street fighter games everything fully perspective lot interesting mechanics new version enjoy gets stamp approval grab sale enjoy
"Great game if you are a Jurassic Park fan. It is very short though, 4 episodes total and i spent 6 hours beating all 4 with some paused time and 17 deaths. So I could see this being a 5 hour game for some. With that said you might want to get this during a sale. full price which i Think is 30 bucks is not worth it at all. but if you can get it on sale it is enjoyable. This is only the second Telltale game ive played with this style of gameplay. The Other being Game Of Thrones. So far through 2 episodes of Game of thrones I would compare the two with Jurassic Park being more difficult but Game of Thrones episodes are longer and It has a better story. Jurrasic park is more in your face action packed just like the movie. Jurassic Park also has a bit more of a puzzle element that so far Game of thrones lacks.   To sum it up get this on sale if you like Jurassic park or the other telltale games of this style. If its not on sale or you are not a fan of the interactive movie type games then I would stay away.",1,great game jurassic park fan short though episodes total spent hours beating paused time deaths could see hour game said might want get sale full price think bucks worth get sale enjoyable second telltale game ive played style gameplay game thrones far episodes game thrones would compare two jurassic park difficult game thrones episodes longer better story jurrasic park face action packed like movie jurassic park also bit puzzle element far game thrones lacks sum get sale like jurassic park telltale games style sale fan interactive movie type games would stay away

"Why has nobody ever told me about these games?! I just bought the M&amp;M bundle a couple days ago and started with this game. I'd only every played Dark Messiah, and that was not at all what I expected (see my review). I thought Heroes was going to be similar to Warlords: Battlecry or Warcraft. I couldn't have been more wrong.  The only thing this game has in common with Warcraft is the fantasy setting Warcraft is an RTS; M&amp;M is a turn-based wargame with RPG elements. You start the game with one hero, who has a small army attached to her (like twenty troops or something). You run your hero around the map, picking stuff up and claiming buildings for your team. When you get into a battle, you get whisked away to a battle board where you play out a strategic turn-based battle.  The controls are so intuitive that there are times I can't figure something out. Them I DO figure it out and I'm like 'oh. I didn't think it could be that simple.'  I can't wait to play M&amp;M 6, and I can't wait to play the two expansion packs for this game.  My advice: remove your head for a few hours and play this game. It's very easy to play, and there is a decent tutorial.",1,nobody ever told games bought mampm bundle couple days ago started game id every played dark messiah expected see review thought heroes going similar warlords battlecry warcraft couldnt wrong thing game common warcraft fantasy setting warcraft rts mampm turnbased wargame rpg elements start game one hero small army attached like twenty troops something run hero around map picking stuff claiming buildings team get battle get whisked away battle board play strategic turnbased battle controls intuitive times cant figure something figure im like oh didnt think could simple cant wait play mampm cant wait play two expansion packs game advice remove head hours play game easy play decent tutorial

"I really love this game. It's a simple version of the exploration and early development of the New World by European nations. A player interacts with natives and other Europeans and decides how they wish to interact, whether with hostility and agression or as peacably as possible. After a colony is set up, it will need to expand it's infrastructure so more land can be acquired nearby. The game is very much simplified, but it is one that I come back to after years of playing when I want to experience colonizing the New World.",1,really love game simple version exploration early development new world european nations player interacts natives europeans decides wish interact whether hostility agression peacably possible colony set need expand infrastructure land acquired nearby game much simplified one come back years playing want experience colonizing new world

"For the first 30 minutes I often asked myself: 'Why am I even playing this ugly looking, confusing game with bad sound effects ?'. Luckily, the first chapter was soon over and the game started to look, sound and play better the more I played it.  Gravity switching can be confusing at first, and ugly brown cave is not a place where one would like to spend a lot of his/her time trying to figure it out. The later levels are much more varied, colorful and offer many different puzzles and platforming challenges. None of them are extremly hard and checkpoints are very close to each other, so I never found myself stuck for too long.  More varied levels later on also help you appreciate the unique art style of the game more. Combined with the DIY sound effects, that sound like the devs made them with their mouth or hands, makes the game feel like it was crafted on a desk in art class, and not programmed on a computer.  The game takes place in a forest and you encounter some forest wildlife along the way, but unfortunatelly the game has no story. I'm sure there is some folk tale or something that would fit in this world very nicely, and would bring the game to a higher level.  The other problem I had is that camera would sometimes zoom in too much, so I wouldn't know where exactly I was going. A free look mode for the camera, or a zoom feature would have been really helpfull.  CONCLUSION:  There are probably a ton of similar platformers out there today, but I had fun playing this one and it was a nice overall experience. I wouldn't recommend it for the full 10 € price, but if you can get it cheap, have a controller, a comfortable sofa and a bit of patience, give it a go.",1,first minutes often asked even playing ugly looking confusing game bad sound effects luckily first chapter soon game started look sound play better played gravity switching confusing first ugly brown cave place one would like spend lot hisher time trying figure later levels much varied colorful offer many different puzzles platforming challenges none extremly hard checkpoints close never found stuck long varied levels later also help appreciate unique art style game combined diy sound effects sound like devs made mouth hands makes game feel like crafted desk art class programmed computer game takes place forest encounter forest wildlife along way unfortunatelly game story im sure folk tale something would fit world nicely would bring game higher level problem camera would sometimes zoom much wouldnt know exactly going free look mode camera zoom feature would really helpfull conclusion probably ton similar platformers today fun playing one nice overall experience wouldnt recommend full price get cheap controller comfortable sofa bit patience give go

And Logan Cunningham. LOGAN CUNNINGHAM), to the subtlety of the mechanics to the emotional impact of the choices they ask you to make.

"A lot of people compare Terraria to Minecraft but in reality the most they have in common is a few of the same tools and materials and the fact that it's a 'crafting game'. On the PC, there is also a lack of direction and it is up to the player to research what you must do and how to do it.  Terraria's vast catalogue of enemies, terrains and items sets it apart. It's hard not to accidentally have an adventure just going out fishing, or getting ore. It's a game about adaptation and survival. It gets more 'fun' once you get more armor and weapons to explore more easily with and then Hardmode is another can of worms. One minute you excitedly tell your brother over skype that you found a rare ore and the next you are shrieking 'BEES BEES BEES ♥♥♥♥ING BEES ♥♥♥♥ING ME SIDEWAYS'.   Some people complain about chance occurances in your worlds (Corruption vs. Crimson, ore vs alt ore) being a waste but I call it replay value. Starting a new world and doing the exact same thing as the old one but being excited about things that are new to you is great. It also encourages world-jumping with a character, something not possible on many other games.   All and all, it's a really fun game, it gets addictive quickly. If it starts to feel stale at all, play with friends. Build castles and surf the Wiki, there is so much to do, so much to make.   And don't let the 8 bit look fool you. It gets pretty grotesque.",1,lot people compare terraria minecraft reality common tools materials fact crafting game pc also lack direction player research must terrarias vast catalogue enemies terrains items sets apart hard accidentally adventure going fishing getting ore game adaptation survival gets fun get armor weapons explore easily hardmode another worms one minute excitedly tell brother skype found rare ore next shrieking bees bees bees ing bees ing sideways people complain chance occurances worlds corruption vs crimson ore vs alt ore waste call replay value starting new world exact thing old one excited things new great also encourages worldjumping character something possible many games really fun game gets addictive quickly starts feel stale play friends build castles surf wiki much much make dont let bit look fool gets pretty grotesque

"Well, you're either going to find the style humorous or just plain wrong to the point that you can't play. If you're in the first group, you'll find a zelda-like rogue game from half the folks that brought you Super Meat Boy. It's not nearly as punishingly difficult as the boy of meat's adventure, though still more difficult than typical of modern games. The gameplay definitely strikes a one-more-game chord. I highly recommend looking up joy to key, like the devs recommend, and plugging in a gamepad. Wish that option was native, but the game was coded for a version of Flash that doesn't support pads or even GPU acceleration. It has since been coded in a different language, but the support wasn't added. 4/5",1,well youre either going find style humorous plain wrong point cant play youre first group youll find zeldalike rogue game half folks brought super meat boy nearly punishingly difficult boy meats adventure though still difficult typical modern games gameplay definitely strikes onemoregame chord highly recommend looking joy key like devs recommend plugging gamepad wish option native game coded version flash doesnt support pads even gpu acceleration since coded different language support wasnt added

"The gameplay was enjoyable even though I'm not a huge fan of games with stealth elements. There were quite many mini-games as well, which were fairly enjoyable too. The story was good and I will probably get the sequel, if it ever comes out on PC (currently in development for the next generation of consoles). Only real downside was the length of the game since I beat the game in about 11 hours and I collected and did everything during that time. There were only 3-4 quite lengthy missions in the game, each with a boss in the end.  The game is kinda old though and doesn't work that well on modern computers. There were some graphical glitches at first but with a little bit of tweaking, I managed to make them disappear.  Overall the game was good and I recommend playing it to everyone who likes stealthy action-adventure games.",1,gameplay enjoyable even though im huge fan games stealth elements quite many minigames well fairly enjoyable story good probably get sequel ever comes pc currently development next generation consoles real downside length game since beat game hours collected everything time quite lengthy missions game boss end game kinda old though doesnt work well modern computers graphical glitches first little bit tweaking managed make disappear overall game good recommend playing everyone likes stealthy actionadventure games

"I had heard of this game a lot when it came up, I had seen the trailers for it a long time ago, the awesome anime-ish style trailers and seen very small amounts of gameplay. Let me tell you, I have only (At the time of me writing this review) played about 25 minutes. Already love this game. FIrst off, I was happy how my crappy PC ran this game so smoothly, Secondly, I LOVE How your character Faith Feels, her movements are so fluid, like water, so agile and graceful. I freaking LOVE IT. And it needs to be all these things in order to play the game. The game it'self is more of a puzle game slightly portal-esque, Minus portal, Why it reminds me of portal is because it uses the enviroment as the puzzles, I freaking love that. There are so many ways to move, like making yourself smaller in mid air so you can hop over barbed wire fences, Zipline, slide, climb, shimmy, sidestep, wall ride, roll to save yourself from taking damage.

Xcom ememy unknown is a perfect break from games like cod thanks to its turn based battle and story.Xcom battle likely the best part of the game is done perfectly the only problem i had with it is that is that you have to find the aliens before they do anything this can be a problem. I once spent 10 mins just looking for this last alien which was hidden in the building.Oherwise the game even on easy can be pretty challenging you can't just rush into battle even with some of the best gear.And outside of battle is you're base which you can look for missions research and creat wepons buildings armor and even ships.But i would not EVER think about playing this game on inpossible as soon as you get there is a reason that theres a achivment for beating just ONE mission on impossibe.The story is decent but you never really figure out why the aliens are invadeing earth which buged me quite a bit.The mutiplayer is great except for a few bugs and glitches but really the only reason to play is to play as the aliens.Xcom is a game that i would highly recommed to anyone who is a fan of games like this.,1,xcom ememy unknown perfect break games like cod thanks turn based battle storyxcom battle likely best part game done perfectly problem find aliens anything problem spent mins looking last alien hidden buildingoherwise game even easy pretty challenging cant rush battle even best gearand outside battle youre base look missions research creat wepons buildings armor even shipsbut would ever think playing game inpossible soon get reason theres achivment beating one mission impossibethe story decent never really figure aliens invadeing earth buged quite bitthe mutiplayer great except bugs glitches really reason play play aliensxcom game would highly recommed anyone fan games like

"this game is the definition of a what a turn based tactical game should be. unlike the majority of turn based games which have you control an army this game gets on a more personal level giving you an army but only alowing use of a squad containing from 4 to 6 units. gameplay includes a 3d checkerboard style map.  the game contains hours of gameplay and can be modded. combat is based on a percent chance sysetem that truly holds to its discription. a 95% chance to hit has a 5% chance to miss.  the game has a built in ironman mode even if you dont select ironman. characters die when they die making you care more about the lives of your soldiers.  multiplayer is a waistland of fun and overall disipointment. due to the lack of players and age of the game the ranked and regular matches are nonexistant. though when you do get a match it is well worth the wait. the game is riddled with bugs but none that overall harm gameplay.   but this game is fun! in fact i would say its better than most if not all other tbs games on the market. all the complicated boring small insignificant desisions that most games throw right into the core of the game in a turn based game are separated in xcom. your base tactical map and any of the complicated things to ballance are all separated from your combat system. and the combat is clean simple easy to understand with a recongisable form of turn based tactitcs. a unit will move a set amount of spaces into cover and take % shots on units in sight. with a more personal aproach on the game instead of an army a player can feel less overwelmed and think more tactical. and in the out of combat systems the game starts off slow only giving you access to so much as you progress. this allows new players to not feel overwelmed by the vast amount of information. the entire game is in a way a tutorial on how to use each of the out of combat systems never giving you too much to focus on at one time, while still alowing you to build your base and your troops your own way and progress in the way you want. and the difficulty increases in the ways you expect it to. normal is normal not an easy mode with a different name to make players feel better. hard can be a challenge the first time around and picking the hardest difficlulty or ironman mode further increases the level of suffering for hardcore players. there are no timers on turns and even the most challenging difficulty can be played in a casual way.  i highly recomend this game. and with the next in line coming soon i would recomend this game more to new players. this will be one of the games when its not hard to play the old one first before playing the new one. the story is worth it and its not hard to get through on the easier difficluties.",1,game definition turn based tactical game unlike majority turn based games control army game gets personal level giving army alowing use squad containing units gameplay includes checkerboard style map game contains hours gameplay modded combat based percent chance sysetem truly holds discription chance hit chance miss game built ironman mode even dont select ironman characters die die making care lives soldiers multiplayer waistland fun overall disipointment due lack players age game ranked regular matches nonexistant though get match well worth wait game riddled bugs none overall harm gameplay game fun fact would say better tbs games market complicated boring small insignificant desisions games throw right core game turn based game separated xcom base tactical map complicated things ballance separated combat system combat clean simple easy understand recongisable form turn based tactitcs unit move set amount spaces cover take shots units sight personal aproach game instead army player feel less overwelmed think tactical combat systems game starts slow giving access much progress allows new players feel overwelmed vast amount information entire game way tutorial use combat systems never giving much focus one time still alowing build base troops way progress way want difficulty increases ways expect normal normal easy mode different name make players feel better hard challenge first time around picking hardest difficlulty ironman mode increases level suffering hardcore players timers turns even challenging difficulty played casual way highly recomend game next line coming soon would recomend game new players one games hard play old one first playing new one story worth hard get easier difficluties

"My Take: An okay point and click adventure with a nonsensical plot about climate change. It's fairly short, if you're dedicated to playing it, then it shouldn't take more than about 6 hours. The puzzles are dull and convoluted at times.  Graphics: The art is fairly well done, but the animations can be a little jittery at times. While the resolution can be set to widescreen, the game is played in 4:3; so you've got pillarboxing and unnecessary screen scrolling.  Sound: Voice acting is wooden and mostly boring. Not too much happening in the sound effects department. Prepare to hear a lot of clicks.  Music: Enjoyable enough to make this game a less arduous task.  Controls: Not really a fan of the “left click to bring up options wheel” scheme when left click is also move. Right click opens/closes your inventory.  Did I Finish It: Yes.  Will I Play it Again: If I really am bored and want to grab the four remaining achievements, maybe. I doubt that'll be any time soon though.  Should You Buy It: If you really wanted to play every point and click adventure on Steam, you could probably do worse than this.",1,take okay point click adventure nonsensical plot climate change fairly short youre dedicated playing shouldnt take hours puzzles dull convoluted times graphics art fairly well done animations little jittery times resolution set widescreen game played youve got pillarboxing unnecessary screen scrolling sound voice acting wooden mostly boring much happening sound effects department prepare hear lot clicks music enjoyable enough make game less arduous task controls really fan left click bring options wheel scheme left click also move right click openscloses inventory finish yes play really bored want grab four remaining achievements maybe doubt thatll time soon though buy really wanted play every point click adventure steam could probably worse

"First off, this is a good game, it has solid mechanics and it is fun to play but there are problems (Disclaimer: I am a complete fan of the original)  Having said that, it is a pale shadow of the mighty first game from which it takes its name (And even X-COM: Apocalypse) and it appears to be a syndrome that a lot of remakes suffer. The problem could be called 'Streamlining' (Total War Rome 2 has this problem as well).  1st is the research tree which is significantly smaller than the original. There is only one advanced Interceptor and very few weapons for it to research. The squad sizes are also very small (4-6) compared to the original so when you lose someone experienced it hurts a lot! (Losing 1 or 2 people in a mission early on can cripple your chances of completing it.) The maps are smaller and the mechanics of engaging enemies (Small groups that get their own '!' animation when you come across them) is disappointing.  Base building has been made much less interesting since in the original your base could be invaded (and you could have multiple bases). The X-COM: Enemy Within expansion does actually have a base defense mission but it is scripted, happens once, and how you built your base does not come into it.  Which brings me to my main problem with the new X-COM. I do not feel like the Commander of X-COM. In the original there were no scripted events, it was all organic gameplay. I made the decisions, I hired the scientists, bought the ammo, kitted out the soldiers in details and planned ahead and I was fighting for the Earth. This may sound dull but it added to the immersion.  In the new X-COM the game plays out with 3 main characters and I feel incidental to the whole thing. I could just go put some slippers on and let them do it. You are hand-held and guided through every part of the game, constantly being told what to do, what you should do and what to expect by the 'main' characters.   This game is also much shorter in terms of the time taken to complete it. I just finished a game having shot down a mere 6 UFOs. In the original I would barely be seeing more than their initial scouts at this point. The ending is also very abrupt and jarring.  So yes, this is a good game overall, it has some of the hallmarks of the original but overall it is a hollow shell compared to it, even with the expansion (Which I HIGHLY recommend). I am hoping that some of the X-COM indie games like Xenonauts (  http://www.xenonauts.com/  and early access on Steam ) can give me my real X-COM old-school fix.",1,first good game solid mechanics fun play problems disclaimer complete fan original said pale shadow mighty first game takes name even xcom apocalypse appears syndrome lot remakes suffer problem could called streamlining total war rome problem well st research tree significantly smaller original one advanced interceptor weapons research squad sizes also small compared original lose someone experienced hurts lot losing people mission early cripple chances completing maps smaller mechanics engaging enemies small groups get animation come across disappointing base building made much less interesting since original base could invaded could multiple bases xcom enemy within expansion actually base defense mission scripted happens built base come brings main problem new xcom feel like commander xcom original scripted events organic gameplay made decisions hired scientists bought ammo kitted soldiers details planned ahead fighting earth may sound dull added immersion new xcom game plays main characters feel incidental whole thing could go put slippers let handheld guided every part game constantly told expect main characters game also much shorter terms time taken complete finished game shot mere ufos original would barely seeing initial scouts point ending also abrupt jarring yes good game overall hallmarks original overall hollow shell compared even expansion highly recommend hoping xcom indie games like xenonauts httpwwwxenonautscom early access steam give real xcom oldschool fix
"Chances are that if you like platformers, then at some point in your life you've probably heard of Cave Story. That's because it really is one of the best.  The platforming is superb. While it can be difficult to get the hang of controlling your character at first, it becomes easier  quickly   eventually  after a few dozen deaths. There are several different weapons to collect during your adventure, and no, it's not possible to have all of them in one playthrough. The level design is excellent, enemy attacks are simple to learn but can still provide challenge, and while the art style and music are always up to individual preference, I've never heard anyone say that the soundtrack was anything less than excellent. But what really makes this game special is its heart. That makes it difficult to review, of course, but if you're still divided, just look at the steam review scores. Or heck, anyone's review scores. The game is good, people.  A word to the wise: the game is also difficult, even for a platforming buff like me. If you're not a regular platformer, choose the easy difficulty - having played through the original difficulty and aiming to get the 'secret' ending, I can promise that I did not always feel as fondly about the game as I do now.",1,chances like platformers point life youve probably heard cave story thats really one best platforming superb difficult get hang controlling character first becomes easier quickly eventually dozen deaths several different weapons collect adventure possible one playthrough level design excellent enemy attacks simple learn still provide challenge art style music always individual preference ive never heard anyone say soundtrack anything less excellent really makes game special heart makes difficult review course youre still divided look steam review scores heck anyones review scores game good people word wise game also difficult even platforming buff like youre regular platformer choose easy difficulty played original difficulty aiming get secret ending promise always feel fondly game
GREAT GAME WITH UNLIMITED REPLAYABILITY!  Pros: -Great combat system -Large amount of items to find and different things to craft -Building system works well for placing items -Crafting system is great and is easy to navigate -Variety of powers that make the game very rewarding to go treasure hunting -Large maps that award adventuring -Co-op both local and over the internet -Great building mechanics -Digging down has different layers that provide different enemys making for a great progression system -Random attacks or raids to keep you on your toes while your digging in your hole -Boss battles take actual stategy to beat and feel very rewarding when you do manage to down one -Traps and different tools to help defend your base -I loved the idea of building a room of a certain size and with certain items to get shop keepers to move in!  Cons: -No real tutorial but that wasn't really a problem for me -Menu is a bit clunky but once you've played for a while it gets easy to manage -You haven't bought the game yet!  Overall I would recommend this game to anyone that likes a great game that won't break the bank yet provide them with hours and hours of fun. It's something you can always go back to if you need something to play or to kill some time. Casual and serious gamers can get their fix with the different difficulty modes and the perma-death mode as well adding an extra challenge.,1,great game unlimited replayability pros great combat system large amount items find different things craft building system works well placing items crafting system great easy navigate variety powers make game rewarding go treasure hunting large maps award adventuring coop local internet great building mechanics digging different layers provide different enemys making great progression system random attacks raids keep toes digging hole boss battles take actual stategy beat feel rewarding manage one traps different tools help defend base loved idea building room certain size certain items get shop keepers move cons real tutorial wasnt really problem menu bit clunky youve played gets easy manage havent bought game yet overall would recommend game anyone likes great game wont break bank yet provide hours hours fun something always go back need something play kill time casual serious gamers get fix different difficulty modes permadeath mode well adding extra challenge

"This game is definitely interesting. While it's honestly something I never would have played without getting a previous Humble Bundle, I'm glad I did in the end. And Yet it Moves employs something that's not totally unfamiliar to a number of games, but still manages to keep it fresh enough and utilizes the mechanic well enough to keep the minor issues I had with it from keeping me from quitting. [Those issues mostly include the flimsiness of the main character. While I'm sure someone could say, 'But he's made of paper, of course he's flimsy!' there were still a lot of times I felt cheated out of a safe landing.] With no real story, And Yet It Moves is more of an aesthetic trip. With trippy ambient sound-music and minimal sound effects, And Yet It Moves is a wonderfully exotic sensory adventure. It is a little slow, so if you're looking for an action packed adventure, I would say look elsewhere, but if you can handle a bit of pacing and some neat physics-based puzzling, try it!",1,game definitely interesting honestly something never would played without getting previous humble bundle im glad end yet moves employs something thats totally unfamiliar number games still manages keep fresh enough utilizes mechanic well enough keep minor issues keeping quitting issues mostly include flimsiness main character im sure someone could say hes made paper course hes flimsy still lot times felt cheated safe landing real story yet moves aesthetic trip trippy ambient soundmusic minimal sound effects yet moves wonderfully exotic sensory adventure little slow youre looking action packed adventure would say look elsewhere handle bit pacing neat physicsbased puzzling try

For people having the games for windows live problem, I suggest looking up a fix for Fallout 3 that tells you to download a little program that turns off GFWL because Fallout 3 isn't for newer computers and GFWL is dead. That program MIGHT fix your problem. All in all this game is still giving me some enjoyment even after all these years. For the people who can play this game, I suggest you try out some mods. It doesn't have as many mods as GTA SA does, but there are some good ones and adding mods or replacing the models for cars and guns is really simple and it makes this old game slightly more fun.",1,ive looking negative reviews ive seen less problem people cant log social club game crashes lot etc somewhat lowend computer thats currently running windows college computer run gta iv somwhat low settings im getting crashes bought online code game amazon one reason mods people games windows live problem suggest looking fix fallout tells download little program turns gfwl fallout isnt newer computers gfwl dead program might fix problem game still giving enjoyment even years people play game suggest try mods doesnt many mods gta sa good ones adding mods replacing models cars guns really simple makes old game slightly fun

"They never come in peace. XCOM: Enemy Unknown (or just XCOM for short) is a stradigy game that puts you face first into the meat grinder. You know that soldier you have that has been on every mission with you this far, now he is dead, you remerber that small country in south america that got atacked, well now they are no longer paying you to save the world. This game has many levels that you can go past with little resistence, then the next level all of you best units start killing each other. This game is not for the faint of heart, most missions feel like they can be your last. Your base of operation has a nice feel to it with the area 51 type vibe to it, and upgrading all of your units with better wepons used from alien tec feels nice. The best comparison I can think of for this game is fire emblem, but with aliens and all of you freind dead. This is not a casual game, expect to fail, I suggest to save often, or if you have the balls have iorn man mode on so you only have one save file.

The graphics are top notch, as well as the gameplay (even though the shooting parts can be a bit repetitive sometimes, but that doesn't disturb me very much actually... it is compensated by some lovely interesting physics puzzles; reminds me a bit of the good old HL2 style), but I can't point out enough HOW MUCH I love the story of this game. It really is its strongest point, and I simply love it. You should definitively buy this game if you like action/horror games with an intense and very deep (horror)story. And the soundtrack? Never mind that.... gives me goosebumps EVERY time I play it! Just AWESOME. Go play it now if you haven't already!",1,alan wake awesome story damn intense cant stop playing obviously given like psychohorror thriller genre strange tv serieslike subdivision episodes instead standard game chapters actually quite refreshing opinion graphics top notch well gameplay even though shooting parts bit repetitive sometimes doesnt disturb much actually compensated lovely interesting physics puzzles reminds bit good old hl style cant point enough much love story game really strongest point simply love definitively buy game like actionhorror games intense deep horrorstory soundtrack never mind gives goosebumps every time play awesome go play havent already

Scream obsecnities when you get caught in that stupid obnoxious melee combo that Hunters use. Hate the game because animation canceling doesn't work unless you're an NPC.

"This is a great game to sink hours upon hours into, still only got to the middle, but I am hooked, as simple as it is, building ships and fitting them with weapons you grinded for and blowing up enemy ships has some retro-ish vibes that scratch an itch that modern games just don't give you anymore.  SPAZ is kind of like a forgiving rouge like, it has many elements of a rogue like, but you don't loose much if you die, if you have ever felt like going all in guns blazing in a rouge like, but went the safe route because you didn't want to loose your stuff? SPAZ will scratch that itch.  The 'cling cling cling' sound of missiles detaching from your ship, the radio chatter, getting used to your new customized ship's drag while you whiz around firing and dogging enemy fire is such a satisfying experience.  Also its nice that you have multiple ships to command and can switch to with ease, you can build your fleet in such a way that is very specific to your tactics, which would not work if the ships are controlled by AI.  It does get tedious to grind for materials, but not to the point its annoying.  I actually bought SPAZ 2 before this, but I don't plan to move my way up to it just yet, SPAZ 1 is just too addicting to let go.",1,great game sink hours upon hours still got middle hooked simple building ships fitting weapons grinded blowing enemy ships retroish vibes scratch itch modern games dont give anymore spaz kind like forgiving rouge like many elements rogue like dont loose much die ever felt like going guns blazing rouge like went safe route didnt want loose stuff spaz scratch itch cling cling cling sound missiles detaching ship radio chatter getting used new customized ships drag whiz around firing dogging enemy fire satisfying experience also nice multiple ships command switch ease build fleet way specific tactics would work ships controlled ai get tedious grind materials point annoying actually bought spaz dont plan move way yet spaz addicting let go

Your mission is to investigate the alien race behind the attack and save the Galaxy. Without going into anymore detail, as I wouldn't want to ruin it for you. Mass Effect is one of my all time favorite video game series, as the story just draws you in. The characters give you some back story, and you can explore the homeworlds of several council races, as well as explore the galaxy in general with your ship. Choices you make effect the gameplay overall and can be carried from the First Mass Effect into 2 and 3.   The game is played in third-person mode, has a magnificent story and is visually pleasing to play. The only criticism I have for this does not come against the game itself, but against Steam for not having Mass Effect 3.

"A very intense multiplayer experience. The game is currently in its 'Vanilla' version and there is still some balancing/tweaking/polishing to be done. That doesn't mean, however, that this isn't a quality product. Far from it. First of all, it feels very 'unique'. I haven't played any other FPS/RTS hybrid in the past, i have tried however most multiplayer shooters that have come out in the last 4-5 years and this one feels much more intense. Even if you prefer a lone-wolf approach in multiplayer games this game will make you want to get involved with the team to hold out that capture point for 30s longer, to siege that turret and EMP their spawns, leaving you with an adrenaline rush and a great sense of satisfaction, knowing that you won that battle fighting tooth and nail against the opponent. Dev support is also a big plus for this one.

"I have mixed feelings about this installment of Prince of Persia. I read several reviews online that gave glowing reviews of this sequel and said that it was far better than Warrior Within. I completely disagree. If you've played through Sands of Time and Warrior Within, then of course you should buy this game and see how the story ends. But I finished the game feeling dissatisfied.  The game offers two major improvements over Warrior Within: the speed-kill system and a better atmosphere. The speed-kill system lets you dispatch enemies from stealth, like an assassin. I guess it was pretty cutting edge back in 2005, but I didn't feel the magic. Sure, it opens up an entirely new play style, but it takes some trial-and-error to get the timing right. This killed the mood for me. What's the point of a cool, cinematic fight sequence if I have to keep retrying it because I missed the timing on a single click of the mouse? I didn't master the speed-kill system until about halfway through the game, and by that point it had lost its appeal. My verdict: the speed-kill system is great on your second play through, but be prepared to invest some practice before you can pull it off consistently.   I won't say too much about the atmosphere, except that it's an improvement. The designers set the game in Babylon and got rid of the gothic Warrior Within vibe. So that's a plus. Oh, and there are some very cool battles where you can fight with chains.  So what about the problems? Well, there are several. To avoid spoiling anything, I'll just mention that the prince has a certain 'dark companion' in this installment. Their dialogue is meant to be a witty banter but it really falls flat. The 'dark companion' dialogues are cheesy and his voice sounds whiny rather than menacing.  My major annoyance has to do with the boss battles. In my opinion, what made earlier installments of Prince of Persia so great was their level design. A reasonably skilled player could fight through entire levels and puzzles without having to reload constantly. Sure, there were a few mindbending challenges, but generally the games were high-paced and exciting. Warrior Within is the perfect example of this: the Dahaka chases were fast-paced races that kept you on your toes and that rewarded quick-thinking. You didn't have to practice over and over again just to succeed on a Dahaka chase sequence.   Two Thrones is just the opposite. Most of the bosses can only be killed if you know the specific trick sequence necessary to finish them off. For almost all of the bosses, there is no way you will figure out the trick on your first try. The boss battles completely kill the pacing of the game because you have to stop and figure out the specific trick you have to use to get through the challenge. It's not at all appropriate for a high-speed adventure game series like Prince of Persia. Also, just because you've played through the first two games without any trouble does not mean you'll be ready for this third game. I spent the first 25% of the game just learning the new timing and figuring out the new sets.   To sum up: Two Thrones has a cool speed-kill system and a better atmosphere than Warrior Within. These features are great for your second and third playthroughs, because by that point you'll know the game's tricks and you'll be able to play it at an exciting, high speed. But otherwise it's a definite downgrade from Warrior Within. Sands of Time and Warrior Within are still fun to play in 2015 (and great bargains these days)--Two Thrones just kind of sucks. But you should play it anyway if you've already been through Sands of Time and Warrior Within, because that way you can see how the story ends.",-1,mixed feelings installment prince persia read several reviews online gave glowing reviews sequel said far better warrior within completely disagree youve played sands time warrior within course buy game see story ends finished game feeling dissatisfied game offers two major improvements warrior within speedkill system better atmosphere speedkill system lets dispatch enemies stealth like assassin guess pretty cutting edge back didnt feel magic sure opens entirely new play style takes trialanderror get timing right killed mood whats point cool cinematic fight sequence keep retrying missed timing single click mouse didnt master speedkill system halfway game point lost appeal verdict speedkill system great second play prepared invest practice pull consistently wont say much atmosphere except improvement designers set game babylon got rid gothic warrior within vibe thats plus oh cool battles fight chains problems well several avoid spoiling anything ill mention prince certain dark companion installment dialogue meant witty banter really falls flat dark companion dialogues cheesy voice sounds whiny rather menacing major annoyance boss battles opinion made earlier installments prince persia great level design reasonably skilled player could fight entire levels puzzles without reload constantly sure mindbending challenges generally games highpaced exciting warrior within perfect example dahaka chases fastpaced races kept toes rewarded quickthinking didnt practice succeed dahaka chase sequence two thrones opposite bosses killed know specific trick sequence necessary finish almost bosses way figure trick first try boss battles completely kill pacing game stop figure specific trick use get challenge appropriate highspeed adventure game series like prince persia also youve played first two games without trouble mean youll ready third game spent first game learning new timing figuring new sets sum two thrones cool speedkill system better atmosphere warrior within features great second third playthroughs point youll know games tricks youll able play exciting high speed otherwise definite downgrade warrior within sands time warrior within still fun play great bargains daystwo thrones kind sucks play anyway youve already sands time warrior within way see story ends

I am glad i didnt buy this game but was given it. This game is a battle game and Arena battle game. You choose a character and select special commands and potions and things for the character. And then go into battle trying to gain control of the map. Controls are sub par. As the UI shows what buttons to push....yet pushing those buttons results in nothing happening. That was the problem i had.....I had no idea how to cotrol my character. Interface was totaly counter intuitive. In addition your character supposedly could be selected to have a high attack value and you can get items to make them stronger....i did this...and the result was the same thing when i chose a weak character. In other words the actual balance in this game and information is wrong...my supposedly very strong archer was weak as a character with barely any strength. It seams also your character will automaticaly use things whether you want them to or not at time. In game I had to scroll the map weirdly i couldnot zoom out much....and combat was...well.....very slowish...and reminded me of a real time strategy game....but with horrible controls and a bad UI.

"TL;DR (Save $10, don't buy this garbage.)  After playing his load of garbage for many hours I can finally conclude that it isn't worth $10 or even $5 or anything at all. It is a 2-D sandbox with zero effort put into it and a very unbalanced difficulty system. At first glance it looks all well and good but after you reach a certain point defeating a boss called the Wall of Flesh the game falls into the stupidly difficult Hard mode where monster kill you in seconds even with 'Hard mode armor' equiped, Overpowered Bosses can spawn at any time including when you don't even have proper weapons to defeat them at all, and stupid events like a Christmas themed 'Frost Moon' occur spawning literally thousands of mobs that kill your NPCs and kill you and force you to die multiple times in a single night costing you loads of money. And the developer for this worthless game has made almost no progress in patching or updating these problems. This is one of the most boring games ever.

"I can't recommend this game. The story is good and all, but the combat makes it next to impossible to to anything significant outside of the main story. Not all the fighting was bad, but the inability to dodge or counter the attacks of certain enemies, combined with not being able to run or climb during combat (making it next to impossible to escape), ruined it.  The control sceme was shifty. Some of the actions the game says you can do with certain keys are not possible. Furthermore, the jumping and climbing as weird.

"Perhaps I had different expectations than I should've coming into this, but after playing the F1 games from Codemasters I expected a lot more.  I've tried this out with my Logitech Driving Force GT and after a bit of confusion and Googling, I discovered that, even though the game 'supports' the wheel, I had to manually assign controls myself. This was annoying, but I figured fair enough. It gets worse when I went into the game proper. From what I can see from my own testing and Google searching there is no force feedback in this game. The wheel is constantly loose, and it gets worse. The driving model is very game-y. I came into this thinking it would be, or at least offer the option of a sim experiance, especially since it's tagged on Steam as such. Instead, after turning all driving aids off, I found that I could soar around the track with total ease and little regard for my vehicle.  If you're after a 'game', then this will probably do you fine. I could imagine it would be decent with a gamepad (I haven't tried this yet, though I'm not sure I can be bothered). If, however, you're after a sim, I'd suggest you get yourself a copy of Assetto Corsa instead.  EDIT: I should also mention that it's not the prettiest game.

"No gamepad support? really? pretty much unplayable on the keyboard.   I wouldn't be so upset about such an omission if it wasn't for the lame 'controller' options in the in-game menu.

I can't understand why the devs can't put in gamepad support for a type of game that really needs it.  I loved super meat boy, laggy bugs not withstanding. But unique art style can only make up for so much.   oh and powerups. no clear indication of what powerups do. some things you just wear on your head... and nothing happens. Yes, you can google it i suppose, but that's also just a lame excuse for the dev to be lazy.  this game is an example of a very wide, but shallow gameplay. Yes, there are a lot of things you can collect and do, but they don't interact in any meaning, interesting way. And even the width of the game isn't clearly explained.

There is some really cool stuff though. The helicopters are really fun to operate and you have a ton of (new) stances you can use to your advantage to find a sweet spot while taking fire. It's worth buying for the price for sure, but I'm a little sad they haven't improved the core more, nor does it look like they will in the beta or final release.",-1,arma facelift honestly wish game know alpha added stuff ive already seen bothersome physics engine still totally broken still using godawful proprietary sqf scripting language makes want kill know theres supposed java integration future thats exactly step likely wont replace sqf rather become addition really cool stuff though helicopters really fun operate ton new stances use advantage find sweet spot taking fire worth buying price sure im little sad havent improved core look like beta final release

"Yes I review a game here everyone else had played years ago and I won't state anything new here, too. I left the series after the very first OF, my computer back than was struggling with the graphics but the game left a lasting impression on me- especially the mission editor was great. I am not a multiplayer guy, online MP is to tough for me, LANs just don't happen anymore. So I am just testing and reviewing the solo player mission here.  What can I say: It is hard. Maybe I just suck, but I rarely have played a game that is so frustrating. The realism is good, although I think the ability of your team mates and your enemy differs a lot. My team rarely hits anything while the enemy snipes you from 500+ meters, whether you lie down or you run zigzag. I like the AI (they flank you when you camp or throw grenades) but all tactics on my side seem to be completely bugged or useless. Telling your team to flank or to suppress simply makes them act stupid (they advance but don't fire OR they start firing wildly but stand still). The team is great at spotting enemies, often long before I see them, but they completely fail at shooting/hitting them. Even a soldier standing still facing his rear side or non moving targets at 25m distance! Then it seems to be impossible to sneak up at someone. I tried at night, crawling through high grass towards an enemy outpost overwatching the other direction. At 25m he turned around and started firing at me. And this triggered the alarm for ALL troops in the mission area. How did he radio/set the alarm while turning around and shooting?  It is good that you cannot sneak/knife through entire missions, but the missions rely on stealth/avoiding contact or firefights. The game spils this everytime you try. It gets pretty annoying restarting missions simply because the game balancing is crap. Everytime you make a tiny mistake (although you did what was expected) combat helicopters show up and blast you to kingdom come. Or entire companies of enemies appear out of thin air and encirlce your position.  I play this game on a medium laptop with just ok settings. This does not work well. Zoom and vision are pretty realistic, enemies at 200m are a handful of pixels only. This game only works well on full resolution and large monitors. You should also be able to have good to max video settings at hand, otherwise the surroundings are rendered so roughly that it is almost impossible to tell enemies from objects.  This is not an action game. In large parts it asks you to crawl/sneak through forest or brush land, avoiding being seen. You advance a few dozen meters, then check area with your binoculars. Changing weapon to binocular and back takes awfully long, though.  You can not choose weapons/equipment freely for your missions. You will often wish you could bring a sniper rifle along, but you are not allowed to. You will run out of ammo fast, especially if you don't switch to single fire always. Calling for ammo resupply does not work. Your team mates won't share a single mag with you. Looting dead enemies only works if you get to them fast. They disappear after a few moments. Usually they only carry a minimum equipment set (often their rifle has a single mag left, no spare magazines). I wonder how they can shoot at you endlessly while alive, but when they die their ammunition magically vanishes...  Teammates in vehicles don't fight. They do mount the MG on a jeep while you drive, but don't expect them to use it. Regardless of commands you have given them. They are also not able to drive a vehicle while you mount the weapons... pretty much sucks.  It feels like this game was made for multiplayer and got a handful of bugged and annoying solo missions attached to it later.  It was ok for 10€ but I was pretty disappointed by it. I have to check out the editor options yet, but so far I could not find anything that compares to the easy to use and flexible editor from the original game.

This game is amusing for about 2 hours then it becomes extremely boring. Pretty much all you do is watch a few planes fly around the globle. I tried it with cheats to make the game more interesting. Sadly it did not. Not worth the money at all.,-1,game amusing hours becomes extremely boring pretty much watch planes fly around globle tried cheats make game interesting sadly worth money

"THe game has an interesting combat system and would acutally be fun ... if it was not completely overloaded with sidequests to the point where I simply gave up because I felt so swamped that I had no fun playing anymore.  A linear questline with some sidequests is fine, I even love a ton of sidequests as long as they are structured in any way but as it is here you pretty much can get a quest from every second npc wandering around. They should have put those gazilion quests onto a notice board or something so you can pick those single quests all at once. Also the quest-tracker needs to be a lot better in a game with this many quests. Maybe creating chains would also help instead of single 1-3 step missions.  I bought this game on sale, so not much money lost, still I regret the buy a bit.  In the end, do not get me wrong this can be a very nice game, the combat is interesting, I like the style and it has a lot of audio content (pretty much everything is spoken so there went a LOT of effort into this part of the game - even if some of the actors sound royally bored) ... BUT and this is a big but: this game is only for you if you have a massive amount of time and like running in circles to finish missions for days on end and do not get frustrated by overwhelming amounts of go-there-kill-that-come-back quests. If you are looking for a game that you can go up against for a really long time, pick this one up, if you like even a resemblence of structure (and I am not talking forced lineare gameplay, open world is fine as long as there is some structure that keeps you from getting totally lost) skip it.",-1,game interesting combat system would acutally fun completely overloaded sidequests point simply gave felt swamped fun playing anymore linear questline sidequests fine even love ton sidequests long structured way pretty much get quest every second npc wandering around put gazilion quests onto notice board something pick single quests also questtracker needs lot better game many quests maybe creating chains would also help instead single step missions bought game sale much money lost still regret buy bit end get wrong nice game combat interesting like style lot audio content pretty much everything spoken went lot effort part game even actors sound royally bored big game massive amount time like running circles finish missions days end get frustrated overwhelming amounts gotherekillthatcomeback quests looking game go really long time pick one like even resemblence structure talking forced lineare gameplay open world fine long structure keeps getting totally lost skip

Freaking uncontrollable garbage. You can't even use the mouse because if you move the camera slows down a ton. If you try to fix it then the camera becomes even worse.
