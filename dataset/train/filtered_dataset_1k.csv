"Beautiful game. The beginning is pretty user friendly. Difficulty eases in. I really love the scenery and the curious macabre factor that's tied in. It's fun to get lost in this game.

"Good game. This one has been stated that it's the best Defense type game out there. I felt it was fun but had too steep of a learning curve. Some of the levels get very frustrating and hard. And some of those achievements seem next to impossible to get. This one is definetly for the hard core player. Lots of different modes and challenges. Will keep you busy for many hours and is worth the money. Just be warned and try to not lose your patience and break your keyboard. I personally liked P vs. Z better but thats just me. :P,  As far as being the best of it's kind? I'm sure it is to some, just not me.  Still liked it and is on my favorites list when ever i feel like killing some aliens.  4* out of 5*",1,good game one stated best defense type game felt fun steep learning curve levels get frustrating hard achievements seem next impossible get one definetly hard core player lots different modes challenges keep busy many hours worth money warned try lose patience break keyboard personally liked p vs z better thats p far best kind im sure still liked favorites list ever feel like killing aliens

"If you look at my profile, you can see that I've spent the majority of my time playing this. It is the perfect game for when you want to have fun, but at a bit more relaxed pace than defeating a boss in another game. It is great fun to burn and blow stuff up and the story is pretty good also. At first, it is easy to get your butt kicked, but once you get some decent weapons it is fairly easy. I also LOVE the beautiful views and it's a way to get a dose of sun on a rainy day. The only real negative is the lack of wild animals like tigers, etc. but they fixed that in Far Cry 3. I still prefer this one though. Tip: try to grab a jeep with a grenade launcher because once you have that, you are almost immortal. The big assault truck is very effective also. And make use of the open space with a sniper rifle. I also found the dart gun to be very useful because you can kill like four guys before assaulting a checkpoint, greatly increasing your odds. The first one goes down and it lures other guards over. Muahaha!",1,look profile see ive spent majority time playing perfect game want fun bit relaxed pace defeating boss another game great fun burn blow stuff story pretty good also first easy get butt kicked get decent weapons fairly easy also love beautiful views way get dose sun rainy day real negative lack wild animals like tigers etc fixed far cry still prefer one though tip try grab jeep grenade launcher almost immortal big assault truck effective also make use open space sniper rifle also found dart gun useful kill like four guys assaulting checkpoint greatly increasing odds first one goes lures guards muahaha

"One of those games that is both well programmed and well made to make nuclear war just another giddy joyride. The game focuses on a world during the late 70's and early 80's, where nuclear war is taking place, and up to 6 nations can declare into it, the nations include The European union (and several other nations not currently in the EU) The USSR, (A and some parts of Kazakhstan) Asia (Not Ocenia, Australia, or Mongolia) Lain America (Not including Cuba) Africa, and North America including Canada and the United States. In order to win, you must get more points than your foes, you get points by killing each millions of people with your ICBMs, there are multiple modes, but I'm covering the stock mode. The game starts at Defcon 5, you can place Radar on your territory, Nuclear Silos (Which will shoot down enemy bombers and fighters as well as launch ICBM) and finally, military air bases that can launch Bombers with nuclear capacity, and fighters. Also during Defcon 5, you can place ships, either battleships, which focus on fighting directly at sea, Subs, which can scan the area and launch nuclear missiles (However said launch will let the rest of the players see them) and Carries, that can't fight, but can use depth charges to take out said Subs, and can also launch bombers and fighter jets. (Each jet also has some small amount of radar to let you see enemy silos and Radar) You can only place units until Defcon 3, when battle becomes more intense, and you are allowed to send jets into enemy territory to scan for military bases and whatnot. After getting to Defcon 1, Nuclear weapons are permitted, and can be launched by Bomber, Silo (Which will prevent the Silo from protecting against incoming jet, bomber, or ICBM.) After you or them launch, the entire game flashes with the warning that one of the players dared to go launch nuclear missiles, and silos (Or Subs) That are launching them will be revealed to the world, and nuclear missiles will launch, but will only be seen if it's under a general radar of a team.. A nuclear missile will destroy Radar in one hit, and air bases in two, and silos in three, also destroying half of that building's current housed warfare. (Be it be bombers/fighters or ICBMs) A missile, hitting a city, will kill half it's living population, which is usually a a couple million each hit, depending on where you strike.  Despite a majority of the community is gone, the game is still here, unlike TF2, which is aimed at multiplayer play, this can be played with well programmed AI, of which aren't generic, and actually are quite hard at times. The achieves, however, can't actually be attained form fighting bots, so you have to play online to actually get them, but due to a dwindling community, it's quite hard to find those players, so try to get friends to play if you want to competition against an actual person.",1,one games well programmed well made make nuclear war another giddy joyride game focuses world late early nuclear war taking place nations declare nations include european union several nations currently eu ussr parts kazakhstan asia ocenia australia mongolia lain america including cuba africa north america including canada united states order win must get points foes get points killing millions people icbms multiple modes im covering stock mode game starts defcon place radar territory nuclear silos shoot enemy bombers fighters well launch icbm finally military air bases launch bombers nuclear capacity fighters also defcon place ships either battleships focus fighting directly sea subs scan area launch nuclear missiles however said launch let rest players see carries cant fight use depth charges take said subs also launch bombers fighter jets jet also small amount radar let see enemy silos radar place units defcon battle becomes intense allowed send jets enemy territory scan military bases whatnot getting defcon nuclear weapons permitted launched bomber silo prevent silo protecting incoming jet bomber icbm launch entire game flashes warning one players dared go launch nuclear missiles silos subs launching revealed world nuclear missiles launch seen general radar team nuclear missile destroy radar one hit air bases two silos three also destroying half buildings current housed warfare bombersfighters icbms missile hitting city kill half living population usually couple million hit depending strike despite majority community gone game still unlike tf aimed multiplayer play played well programmed ai arent generic actually quite hard times achieves however cant actually attained form fighting bots play online actually get due dwindling community quite hard find players try get friends play want competition actual person

"This is a good game. It ties in story and gameplay beautifully, something that most games really can't do. The execution is nothing short of stellar. The music is breathtaking, the art gorgeous, and the narrator's voice is honey. And the gameplay, simple as it is, lends itself to some real complexity, and when the game gets difficult it's a real test of skill. One complaint is that you can pretty much just max out one weapon and not touch another for the entirety of the game, but apart from that it's all round a solid package.",1,good game ties story gameplay beautifully something games really cant execution nothing short stellar music breathtaking art gorgeous narrators voice honey gameplay simple lends real complexity game gets difficult real test skill one complaint pretty much max one weapon touch another entirety game apart round solid package

"  Introduction:    Hi, I am Dymma. Bully is a game about a guy called ' Jimmy' (or 'Hawpkins', the surname') that was expelled for so many school and was outted in a special school. The school that he is attended is debt per 4 (  Or Five  ) factions. Your mission is to 'survive' in the school. As long as you play the game you will unlock the cities.     My Experience:     I play this game for a long time. When it realesed I buyed for my PS2. I was a kid, so I was just playing for fun, don't even caring about the storyline. Unfortunately I didn't passed the game. About 2 years later I got the idea to play the game and I passed 100% using cheats to have money/weapons (again, on PS2). Then I buyed on Steam Summer Sale 2016 and passed 100% of the game without cheats and I can definitely say that it is my Favorite Game!     Pros:    - Good storyline; - 'Freedom Experience'; - The game, still when completed all storyline missions, have things to do; - Nice customization of your character; - Creative weapons; - Creative missions; - Have a big variotions of vehicle; - Secret Unlockables; - And a lot of more stuff.     Cons:    - Game isn't optimazed for good pc's, so it can crash very times; - Game kind of buggy;    My Recommendations:    The game is worth 10 euros, BUT try to buy it at 2 euros; If you want to experience the game as max as you can, DONT WATCH ANY YOUTUBE VIDEOS!    This game is... :        8/10",1,introduction hi dymma bully game guy called jimmy hawpkins surname expelled many school outted special school school attended debt per five factions mission survive school long play game unlock cities experience play game long time realesed buyed ps kid playing fun dont even caring storyline unfortunately didnt passed game years later got idea play game passed using cheats moneyweapons ps buyed steam summer sale passed game without cheats definitely say favorite game pros good storyline freedom experience game still completed storyline missions things nice customization character creative weapons creative missions big variotions vehicle secret unlockables lot stuff cons game isnt optimazed good pcs crash times game kind buggy recommendations game worth euros try buy euros want experience game max dont watch youtube videos game

"Arma 3 is a game about realistic physics and game mechanics that make the game feel real. If your looking for a game to go around and shoot people this is not for you. Arma 3 is for the audience who enjoys patience and reward, killing a target is different than you think. There are many ways that you can actually approach missions and the fun little side modes like Arma 3 life. The co-op is very fun and extremely fun if you have friends playing with you. I will say the campaign whilst fun is also a little bit boring without friends.

"Before I bought this game, I thought it would be a Zelda clone. After I bought and played it, I quickly found out that it was a lot different from Zelda. The game has many items that can change how Isaac walk or attack. There are many Item you can find that will make the game very hard or easy depending on what items you get. Other than many items, there are many different bosses that you can find through the game that you have to face. Each time you play, there will be different bosses that you will have to face. So the game will be different every time you play it. Another thing to do is to unlock other items people, and places.   The time you will play the game will vary on how much you want to do in a game. My playthroughs end up being 45 minutes to an hour and 30 minutes. I usually try to go in most of the rooms if I can survive for that long. Other playthroughs would end up to being couple of minute because of dying. You will die, unless you have cheat to prevent it. With all the random enemies and items spawning, it makes it impossible to not die in a couple of playthroughs. You can kill yourself by not paying attention, like killing yourself with a bomb or running into fire.  The DLC 'Wrath of the Lamb is also great to have. Getting the DLC will add more items, bosses, and people to unlock. making the game harder annd more fun.  It is a great game to get. Playing the game is different nearly every time you play it and that is won of the things I love about it.The game is an absolutly amazing game to play and It is one of my favorite games.With wanting to find all the items and wanting to fight all the bosses, it got me addicted to the game. I highly suggest this game to anyone who is thinking about buying it.",1,bought game thought would zelda clone bought played quickly found lot different zelda game many items change isaac walk attack many item find make game hard easy depending items get many items many different bosses find game face time play different bosses face game different every time play another thing unlock items people places time play game vary much want game playthroughs end minutes hour minutes usually try go rooms survive long playthroughs would end couple minute dying die unless cheat prevent random enemies items spawning makes impossible die couple playthroughs kill paying attention like killing bomb running fire dlc wrath lamb also great getting dlc add items bosses people unlock making game harder annd fun great game get playing game different nearly every time play things love itthe game absolutly amazing game play one favorite gameswith wanting find items wanting fight bosses got addicted game highly suggest game anyone thinking buying
"Well, I'll start it off simply put. I played this game from the creation of my steam account (In late 2012) and I consistently played it from that period until around December 2013, for no specific reason.  Basic Positives: The game is very well designed, and has virtually unlimited customisability There has always been a community of players willing to play with me or it's free, so you can easily get your friends to join you if needs be If you don't want to level up too high, you can easily get what you need within a week, and be self sustained with crafting, which is literally used for everything from making basic weapons, to the best vehicles and armour, which might I add, is very detailed and advanced There is a smooth mixture of PvE and PvP areas, which make the big difference, with PvP areas in every area of the map, and plenty of gameplay features for anyone who likes either to play alone, or with a huge clan to enjoy  Basic Negatives: The community isn't the best it could possibly be, and I feel that it is that way because of the development and releases of more MMORPG based games in the last 2 years. With games such as Defiance, Planetside 2 and the ever standing World of Warcraft eating into the community, it's been progressively decreasing in the last year or 2. (There used to be a consistent upto 20000 people online) The game is very heavily based on a single £5 (or whatever in other currencies) to become an efficient crafter, and earn the option of crafting with a waiting list, to put it simply. Personally, I had no issues as I have 4 characters (The max) and each is heavily levelled into various aspects, but it's a shame that that's what the game has had to resort to.  Gameplay: The game was released in 2009 (Not on steam) and has been consistently updated and used by Devs and GM's (General Managers/Moderators) and I seem alot of steady improvement in items, early and late game dynamics and near areas/features. One thing i've enjoyed about the game is that it's never the easy way to play, and challenging the play to do whatever they want/need to do is a key feature in this game, with a very heavily player based community, and teamwork being very heavily needed and used in events and boss battles. The game itself is very good, and requires little to no processing power, with my old 2008 Toshiba laptop easily running the game (Which might I add, had an old AMD Processor/Integrated Graphics). As a whole, it requires little to no power to play and run effectively over the long term.  Community: Fallen Earths community is very unique, with literally all kinds of players involved, and have the capability of being involved, with RP easily implemented into the way you play the game, and more warrior type players can easily goto various areas/towns and just massacre anything and all they want, with areas like that in every Sector of the map. There is even a dedicated map for pure PvP for any and all players, but is usually for much more advanced and high level players.  Enemies/AI: The enemies and AI in Fallen Earth are very advanced for their age, and with enemies like Bosses all having their own unique dungeon like places, and areas with enemies relating to them, as well as an area in one of the later areas which has a prison which is guarded by enemies, and has varying levels and harder enemies as you move in, with around 5 bosses before you reach a 'grand master' type boss, and essentially have to have a big group. Enemies as a whole are very well balanced, and progress very well, with no real intermingling with levels or players in general getting into the thick of a battle with enemies 10 times higher level than they are is literally 0% (Unless they travelled for quite a while).  Conclusion: It always has been, and still is my most played game ever, and I would definitely say to any MMORPG fan, that they should definitely give it a go, and if they need help/advice I will gladly clear up any issues or problems with the game. 9/10 (Only due to community loss)",1,well ill start simply put played game creation steam account late consistently played period around december specific reason basic positives game well designed virtually unlimited customisability always community players willing play free easily get friends join needs dont want level high easily get need within week self sustained crafting literally used everything making basic weapons best vehicles armour might add detailed advanced smooth mixture pve pvp areas make big difference pvp areas every area map plenty gameplay features anyone likes either play alone huge clan enjoy basic negatives community isnt best could possibly feel way development releases mmorpg based games last years games defiance planetside ever standing world warcraft eating community progressively decreasing last year used consistent upto people online game heavily based single whatever currencies become efficient crafter earn option crafting waiting list put simply personally issues characters max heavily levelled various aspects shame thats game resort gameplay game released steam consistently updated used devs gms general managersmoderators seem alot steady improvement items early late game dynamics near areasfeatures one thing ive enjoyed game never easy way play challenging play whatever wantneed key feature game heavily player based community teamwork heavily needed used events boss battles game good requires little processing power old toshiba laptop easily running game might add old amd processorintegrated graphics whole requires little power play run effectively long term community fallen earths community unique literally kinds players involved capability involved rp easily implemented way play game warrior type players easily goto various areastowns massacre anything want areas like every sector map even dedicated map pure pvp players usually much advanced high level players enemiesai enemies ai fallen earth advanced age enemies like bosses unique dungeon like places areas enemies relating well area one later areas prison guarded enemies varying levels harder enemies move around bosses reach grand master type boss essentially big group enemies whole well balanced progress well real intermingling levels players general getting thick battle enemies times higher level literally unless travelled quite conclusion always still played game ever would definitely say mmorpg fan definitely give go need helpadvice gladly clear issues problems game due community loss

"~~~ The rain drizzled merrilessly across the landscape. Even the angry nimbuses knew to keep their distance, the four warriors on the slope meant business. After days of building a sky rail, defeating pillars of the celestial ones, and crafting new weapons impending doom was approaching. The mage studied his crystal ball, readying his deadliest spells. The summoner was hunched over his bewitching table with the candle light casting twisting shadows on his tiki mask. The ranger rummaged in his ammo box, looking for those special green bullets he knew could save his life. The warrior? The warrior stood staring at the moon. The moon that once gave her so much hope. The moon she now knew housed the potential end of her world. The world she spent what seemed like a millenia building, defending, and now maybe losing. She tightened her grip on Daybreak and began sharpening. All they could do was wait. Wait for their finiest or final hour. They did not wait long...  The Moon Lord has awoken!! ~~~  This game is a colorful sandbox full of toys and enemies and epic adventure. But more than that it becomes surprisingly deep. You can feel the story because you ARE the story. Each boss is the next threat to your world, your personal world, and must become another trophy on the wall. You have to gear up and at no stage in the game are you scared enough to hate it nor unchallenged enough not to keep fighting. Come goblins, pirates, and even Santa-shaped tanks, you will fight, craft, and forge your world. This is one of my all time favorite games and can hardly wait to see what Re-Logic does next.",1,rain drizzled merrilessly across landscape even angry nimbuses knew keep distance four warriors slope meant business days building sky rail defeating pillars celestial ones crafting new weapons impending doom approaching mage studied crystal ball readying deadliest spells summoner hunched bewitching table candle light casting twisting shadows tiki mask ranger rummaged ammo box looking special green bullets knew could save life warrior warrior stood staring moon moon gave much hope moon knew housed potential end world world spent seemed like millenia building defending maybe losing tightened grip daybreak began sharpening could wait wait finiest final hour wait long moon lord awoken game colorful sandbox full toys enemies epic adventure becomes surprisingly deep feel story story boss next threat world personal world must become another trophy wall gear stage game scared enough hate unchallenged enough keep fighting come goblins pirates even santashaped tanks fight craft forge world one time favorite games hardly wait see relogic next

"This is really a game about dodging. You must learn to dodge and have your weapon on autofire so you can have a chance of hitting the enemy while you are staying alive. As you go from 'quest' to 'quest' you are exposed to different monster attack algorithms.  The game is brutal when it comes to dying. I will not fight with less than half my hp bar.  The game throws a bunch of Pay-to-win stuff at you, and if you plan on putting any amount of time into the game, then the 'beginners pack' may be good because it is the price of a good game, but in all other ways the pay-to-win stuff is a rip off.  Overall I like this game because it incentivises team work and I have enjoyed getting closer to my brother by helping him out by being another class while we are both playing this game.",1,really game dodging must learn dodge weapon autofire chance hitting enemy staying alive go quest quest exposed different monster attack algorithms game brutal comes dying fight less half hp bar game throws bunch paytowin stuff plan putting amount time game beginners pack may good price good game ways paytowin stuff rip overall like game incentivises team work enjoyed getting closer brother helping another class playing game

"Mirror's Edge is a diamond in the rough, but despite being a jewel, it is a flawed diamond. While being unique and certainly having it owns personality, the game does indeed have its flaws, quite a lot of them, but some are more negliable than others.  First off, this game runs beautifully. It's one of the better optimized games out there and its visuals are quite stunning for its time. Even if your computer is a 'potato' like mine is, you could probably still runs this game decently, if not well.  This game is short though. It can be beaten in under an hour, although for the first time going through the game, you will most likely die many times. It's a bit of a trial and error process and it will take a while to get the execution down. Checkpoints are quite forgiving though and you will rarely find yourself going back more than a buildings away except on a few occasions.  You may also find yourself screaming 'Faith! Why didn't you grab that ledge/pipe/pole/railing?!' Even the best Speedrunners ask this question. Sometimes Faith, the character you control, has other things to do. Fortunately these situations are rare, although I find chapter 2 seems to have the most occurances of this problem, in particular, a certain pipe near the end of the stage. The game also tends to crash, at least for me. Not often but enough to be noticable. Even if it does crash though, the game autosaves often, and continuation checkpoints are fairly frequent so you don't lose more than a minute or two of progress at best. It could also simply be something with my PC the game doesn't like for some reason.  The game has a story, but I personally did not enjoy it very much, as do many of the fans of the game. In fact, this game has been announced to not being canon at all to the sequel that is being currently made, so be prepared to not be impressed.  The game, mechanically, when you finally figure out what you are doing, flows well, but not without its errors. The whole point of the game is to avoid enemies, but there will be many times where you will be forced to fight enemies. Combat itself isn't bad, and can be fun, if it weren't for the fact that disarming your foes wasn't too easy and rewarding to not do it everytime. You will often find yourself running up to an opponent, standing there waiting for them to melee you, and then simply tapping the disarm button to not only grab their weapon, but to knock them out, all at the press of a button. It's not very rewarding when you can run along the wall and kick them, or do a drop kick followed by a furry of punches. Or to aim a jump from above and land right on top of them for a quick take down. This is further plagued with the flow of the game frequently being broken up with climbing through vents, or slower jumping sections that serve as points to load the stage further ahead. Or a point in the stage where you have to slooooowly turn a valve to turn off steam that is blocking your way, or even waiting for a door to -very- slowly open 15 or so seconds later.  Also as you see from the screenshots, this game is very white. Even the few trees that exist in the game are white. In fact, even some roads appear to be white in brightly lit areas. The game still manages to be beautiful though even though at times it seems to lack color in the environment that could have easily been used. The 9th stage (which is the 7th chapter) is my favorite.  I love the game's soundtrack. The ambiance is great and the soft musical notes you hear during the calmer portions of the game is nice, the music for when you are being chased is great. All of the music just really fits into the entire game, and what is going on at the time. The game is actually quite good, as the music will change slightly as you go through. The notes and beat may just change slightly when you go from one building to another, or when you do a certain thing. It may be playing an upbeat music as you get chased through a building, pause for just a brief second as you finally bust your way through the door, your vision slightly blurry as you adjust to the brightness of the sun and when the animation completes, the music continues on again just slightly differently as you now begin jumping over obstacles to get away as bullets whiz by you. And with how fluid the first person motions are, it's actually quite immersive.  This game is not open ended. Every level has a path you have to go through, but there are many ways to get from the start of a stage to the end of one. A novice parkour takes the stairs like a pedestrian. A master parkour will run along a wall, climb up it, jump, and leap over the railing to get up a flight of stairs.  This game... it has bugs. It actually has a lot of bugs. Yet, at least the mechanical ones oddly enhances the gameplay (usually).  For example, taking corners loses you speed, and it can take some time to build back up to a full on sprint again. But doing a sideways jump and turning yourself right lets you take corners with losing little to no momentum. It takes moments where even where you're just running become parts where you are executing commands at every turn in order to keep the maximum momentum of your sprint to get from point A to point B as fast as possible. Through exploits in the mechanics, you can make otherwise impossible jumps into possible, yet risky but rewarding jumps or falls you would otherwise not be able to make or survive which makes speed running this game a joy. You quite literally begin forming your own paths that not even the game designers intended you to take which at least for me is the ultimate joy. It opens the game so much for when you even go beyond the boundries than the game even intended you to go, where a section that normally takes 2 minutes to get through, you managed to go through in mere seconds. It takes a bit of time to get there, but ultimately this isn't a game you're supposed to beat once. It's a game you are to beat it again, and again, and again, where you will finally start getting the ultimate satisfaction from it; when you are flawlessly jumping over this, vaulting over that, not losing a tiny bit of momentum and are continiously running and keeping your speed in a marvelous flow.   Eventually you may even reach the point where, you too, can quite literally vertically climb up an entire building with a combination of side hopping against a wall and then jumping back up in the air to scramble up it, and thusly reach out of bounds on the map as a result. They said they wanted Faith to be an ordinary heroine without any special powers, but when she is able to jump in mid-air by pressing the jump button after kicking from a wall at the exact right time, I beg to differ.    Ultimately, I'd recommend it, but I would say to wait on a good sale for it. As good as the game is (in my opinion), unless you plan to hard core play the game, it's a bit too short to be sweet enough for the standard pricing point. I'd also strongly recommend watching a couple of Youtube videos of it before considering picking it up in the first place. Maybe one of some guy going through it the first time, to see how it's like and give you a moment to realize the mechanics at a reasonable pace. Then, go watch a video of a pro going at it to see the ultimate flow of the game. If you like the mechanics and you like the flow, then it should be a good game for your Games Library.",1,mirrors edge diamond rough despite jewel flawed diamond unique certainly owns personality game indeed flaws quite lot negliable others first game runs beautifully one better optimized games visuals quite stunning time even computer potato like mine could probably still runs game decently well game short though beaten hour although first time going game likely die many times bit trial error process take get execution checkpoints quite forgiving though rarely find going back buildings away except occasions may also find screaming faith didnt grab ledgepipepolerailing even best speedrunners ask question sometimes faith character control things fortunately situations rare although find chapter seems occurances problem particular certain pipe near end stage game also tends crash least often enough noticable even crash though game autosaves often continuation checkpoints fairly frequent dont lose minute two progress best could also simply something pc game doesnt like reason game story personally enjoy much many fans game fact game announced canon sequel currently made prepared impressed game mechanically finally figure flows well without errors whole point game avoid enemies many times forced fight enemies combat isnt bad fun werent fact disarming foes wasnt easy rewarding everytime often find running opponent standing waiting melee simply tapping disarm button grab weapon knock press button rewarding run along wall kick drop kick followed furry punches aim jump land right top quick take plagued flow game frequently broken climbing vents slower jumping sections serve points load stage ahead point stage slooooowly turn valve turn steam blocking way even waiting door slowly open seconds later also see screenshots game white even trees exist game white fact even roads appear white brightly lit areas game still manages beautiful though even though times seems lack color environment could easily used th stage th chapter favorite love games soundtrack ambiance great soft musical notes hear calmer portions game nice music chased great music really fits entire game going time game actually quite good music change slightly go notes beat may change slightly go one building another certain thing may playing upbeat music get chased building pause brief second finally bust way door vision slightly blurry adjust brightness sun animation completes music continues slightly differently begin jumping obstacles get away bullets whiz fluid first person motions actually quite immersive game open ended every level path go many ways get start stage end one novice parkour takes stairs like pedestrian master parkour run along wall climb jump leap railing get flight stairs game bugs actually lot bugs yet least mechanical ones oddly enhances gameplay usually example taking corners loses speed take time build back full sprint sideways jump turning right lets take corners losing little momentum takes moments even youre running become parts executing commands every turn order keep maximum momentum sprint get point point b fast possible exploits mechanics make otherwise impossible jumps possible yet risky rewarding jumps falls would otherwise able make survive makes speed running game joy quite literally begin forming paths even game designers intended take least ultimate joy opens game much even go beyond boundries game even intended go section normally takes minutes get managed go mere seconds takes bit time get ultimately isnt game youre supposed beat game beat finally start getting ultimate satisfaction flawlessly jumping vaulting losing tiny bit momentum continiously running keeping speed marvelous flow eventually may even reach point quite literally vertically climb entire building combination side hopping wall jumping back air scramble thusly reach bounds map result said wanted faith ordinary heroine without special powers able jump midair pressing jump button kicking wall exact right time beg differ ultimately id recommend would say wait good sale good game opinion unless plan hard core play game bit short sweet enough standard pricing point id also strongly recommend watching couple youtube videos considering picking first place maybe one guy going first time see like give moment realize mechanics reasonable pace go watch video pro going see ultimate flow game like mechanics like flow good game games library

"I enjoyed the first postal and postal 2 for the B grade gore and humour. Don't come into this expecting fluid gun control and movement. There are MANY bugs. I have not encountered any that are breakable to the story but more a laughing matter. But they do not overall detract from the humorous gameplay and storyline behind the the sadley aged source engine used. However the good/bad moral alignment can be a little difficult as some missions require you to be bad to complete them. Again, not a major issue for somebody willing to take the time to look past these issues and play it in the same thought as the prequels. Even the controls feel the same. A fun romp through a wild story filled with cursing and blood spurts so over the top you would think they were made to look that way. Hell, you can craft a gun that shoots a cat off it by its butt hole!!! Running with scissors, you have done a good job in all the harsh remarks this game brought with it. Although an ingame map would have been handy...... Still much of the game to play, but first impressions are good. Graphics: 6-7. Gameplay: 7.

It really is its strongest point, and I simply love it. You should definitively buy this game if you like action/horror games with an intense and very deep (horror)story. And the soundtrack?

"Originally written for The Gazebo Issue 1:  One should always have time for well-designed isometric adventure games where the main protagonist has an improbably large hammer. If that wasn't enough, the soundtrack is mostly a beautiful mix of wild west steel guitars and electronic drumbeats, with a couple of stunning acoustic numbers in there. If that wasn't enough, there's a clever level system whereby you get to swap in and out a bunch of alcoholic tipples conferring various bonuses like extra damage, extra lives, new special abilities and more. And if THAT wasn't enough, the whole game is narrated by someone who sounds for all the world like Ron Perlman trying to be Clint Eastwood. And in the end, isn't that what it's really all about?  So the world blew up, and your character wakes up in a floating city that's shaking itself apart. It's all because of the Calamity – some mysterious horrible thing that happened to break the world and turn almost everyone to stone. Grabbing his massive hammer, your character, a manga-style kid , appropriately named “The Kid”, sets out to try and fix things.  Along the way, you'll encounter some fantastic artwork and cleverly designed enemies, and beat the snot out of both while Not Ron Perlman's gravelly tones wash over you like a soothing balm. You'll encounter a few survivors and activate the last best hope for the world – The Bastion. It can rebuild the world, but only if you power it up by searching through some levels to find power cores for it, most of which are guarded by interesting boss fights, like gigantig steam-powered robot bulls, unicorn crocodiles that swim through solid rock before erupting from underneath to bite your legs off, and gigantic sentient plants.  Every power core recovered allows you to upgrade the Bastion. You can acquire buildings to improve your weapons, or buy materials, or stock up on new drinks providing you with new abilities, and more besides. Any survivors you find end up here too, and you can talk to them, after a fashion; All conversations are related to the player by Not Ron Perlman. The story he tells as you progress through the game (both in and out of hacky-slashy funtimes) is excellent too, following several of the survivors as they come to understand what caused the Calamity, the deep rich history of the game world, differing opinions on what to do about it all, conflict, sorrow, revenge, all that good stuff. There were parts where I found myself getting a little misty-eyed, which generally means some well-written tragedy in my book. I started playing thinking that the Narrator would get on my nerves after a bit, but I was delighted to find out that while he talks a lot, he never wastes words on pointless crap, and he never overstays his welcome.   All in all, Bastion is a fine little game, well worth buying. It's full of interesting story, lovely visuals, fantastic sound and it all ties together wonderfully to create something very special. Not enough game developers bother trying something a little bit different these days, and Bastion is exactly that. At the very least, and I know I keep saying this, get the soundtrack.

"Wonderfully addictive action RPG, in a similar vein as Titan Quest and the older Diablo games. The four classes available are different and creative. The steampunk elements sprinkled in help to separate T2's classes from ones in other fantasy games. Dungeons are procedurally generated, allowing for greater replayability. After enough maps you may recognize certain sections repeating.   The story is kinda average. I didn't feel much investment beyond 'complete next step to move on.' The ending felt like just another completion step, not a grand finale. Though it was great to discover additional content available after the ending.  And of course, Torchlight II has a Steam Workshop. Community content is a must-have for all RPGs, IMO. Best way to keep a game vibrant and alive.",1,wonderfully addictive action rpg similar vein titan quest older diablo games four classes available different creative steampunk elements sprinkled help separate ts classes ones fantasy games dungeons procedurally generated allowing greater replayability enough maps may recognize certain sections repeating story kinda average didnt feel much investment beyond complete next step move ending felt like another completion step grand finale though great discover additional content available ending course torchlight ii steam workshop community content musthave rpgs imo best way keep game vibrant alive

"This game surprised me, and got me into the Frogwares Sherlock Holmes games. I originally played it on Xbox 360 as a rental when it released, the Title caught my interest. Turned out to be a game I loved so much I bought it again on Steam. The PC version is far superior with the exception of the following, but don't let it sway you away, it can be corrected. It's not a broken game any means, just needs help on newer hardware when you first install. Some users (like myself) have an issue with the game mot loading initially: for most people this can be easily corrected by opening the game's folder ('C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Sherlock Holmes versus Jack the Ripper\Support\PhysX') and re-installing the two PhysX installers, and selecting the repair option if asked to by the installer for each one.  Now.. about the game. This game has good performance and plays well on a rig that pumps 30 or 60+ FPS. The game looks great too. It may not blow you away graphically, but you can see the developers cared about quality. Little things - like tiny signs pasted to a brick wall are clear and easy to read, the smoke in pubs is realistic, the lighting and shadows are nice and mood-setting: little things like this you will notice as you play. I like this game's style.  The game does have a few places where you can tell they were developing on a budget. Some of the NPC characters walking the streets are recycled, and so are their voices. To top that, the NPC townsfolk have some pretty lame voice overs. However, don't let this stray you! If you play the game like a proper Sherlock Holmes would, you'll soon find out these people are of no use to you, and just ignore them and focus on the case. The good news here, is that the NPC characters you have actual dialogue with in the game, all have pretty good voice acting. I actually like this balance, it made me laugh at the cheesy peasants in the streets as I strolled along to talk to my fancy doctor, merchant, and police colleagues and such. This gave me a real feel for the classic Sherlock Holmes arrogance, lol. Also, you get to have a laugh at prudent Wason in a brothel in the middle of the night, if you are into the books and know his character.  The story isn't half bad either. I really liked the ending. Sure, if you want to be a real nit-picker or snob you could point out all it's imperfections... but you'd just be robbing yourself of a fun game that really did try to stay true to the source material and history, while providing a unique twist to preserve continuity.

"I've played turn-based strategy games for over 30 years, and I have to rate this in the top ten. Excellent Turn-based strategy game. This is squad-based, with up to six characters that you control in a round-robin. You can select them out-of-order on your turn if you need to make tactical changes. The weapons are varied and interesting, and the story line is pretty involved and takes a while to get through. The replay value is pretty high. Although there are a finite number of scenarios and maps, where the aliens show up on those maps varies. For the UFO landing and crash sites, the insertion points are randomly generated. Well-thought out and pretty polished. I've yet to run into a game-related bug, and in an era of buggy releases, that alone gets it a high recommendation from me.  Drawbacks: Flying units are at times difficult to position. Try changing the camera angle if there is a movement spot that you just can't seem to get to.",1,ive played turnbased strategy games years rate top ten excellent turnbased strategy game squadbased six characters control roundrobin select outoforder turn need make tactical changes weapons varied interesting story line pretty involved takes get replay value pretty high although finite number scenarios maps aliens show maps varies ufo landing crash sites insertion points randomly generated wellthought pretty polished ive yet run gamerelated bug era buggy releases alone gets high recommendation drawbacks flying units times difficult position try changing camera angle movement spot cant seem get

"Originally this game was suppose to be military / army training simulator, but it was turned into a game. Because of the nature of game, it's very realistic and developers have put lot of effort making it as real as possible, however lot of bugs and glitches remain.  In fact 2 developers went as far as going to 'spy' on a real military base in Greece and got arrested by the military and their bail was denied, because Greeks accused them in espionage. Google it up if you don't believe me, they were in prison for over 4 months before they finally got out, this is how far they went to get their content right.  Game is very tactical and realistic, it takes only couple of bullets to kill someone, even if they are wearing full armor. Bullets have realistic bullet drop, so weapon scopes must be zeroed to right distance. I love all the tactical side of the game, but movement and land vehicle controls are bad. Cars flip and slide for no reason, however helicopter and plane controls are quite good.  What i don't like about this game, is those glitches. for example sometimes you stand on top of a rock or something similar and your character just starts sliding down like some matroska and then you fall maybe like 2-3 meters and you die instantly, in real life ... would never happen, unless you trying to kill yourself by falling on your head and breaking your neck, even then it would be hard to kill yourself.  I do recommend this game, but it's way overpriced and those DLCs are too expensive too, even for a youtuber like me .. it's way too much. Spending 100+ eur on a game is ridiculous. However there's workshop, which makes it easy to mod.  In general game is totally worth playing, but could be better.",1,originally game suppose military army training simulator turned game nature game realistic developers put lot effort making real possible however lot bugs glitches remain fact developers went far going spy real military base greece got arrested military bail denied greeks accused espionage google dont believe prison months finally got far went get content right game tactical realistic takes couple bullets kill someone even wearing full armor bullets realistic bullet drop weapon scopes must zeroed right distance love tactical side game movement land vehicle controls bad cars flip slide reason however helicopter plane controls quite good dont like game glitches example sometimes stand top rock something similar character starts sliding like matroska fall maybe like meters die instantly real life would never happen unless trying kill falling head breaking neck even would hard kill recommend game way overpriced dlcs expensive even youtuber like way much spending eur game ridiculous however theres workshop makes easy mod general game totally worth playing could better

"Time to write a serious review (pfft serious) now that Valve added this review thing. Kay.  So, I've always been the kind to really despise games where you win based off of luck and luck alone. And yet, this game does rely on luck, but not to the point where it's all you'll win based off of. A bit of skill is involved, in dodging shots and movement, knowing when to pick items, and when to ditch them. The game play is always randomized, so you never know what you're going to get unless you're using a seed in Spidermod. Anyhow, I'm gonna split this review into two main parts, and then extra things. Plot, gameplay, and then anything extra I'd like to add.  Plot: The plot of this game is simple, yet it makes enough sense to be a plot. To keep it short, some little kid named Isaac's mother hears the voice of god, saying how corrupt with sin Isaac is, and eventually God tells his mother to kill Isaac in sacrifice. Simple, but pretty messed up. And in escape, Isaac jumps into the basement, unknowing of what's below. Overall, it's a plot, it makes sense, and it ties into the game. Yeah. I personally like how simple the plot is. Just my opinion.  Gameplay: Now, for the gameplay, you're thrown into a randomly generated dungeon, and it plays top-down, similar to the Legend of Zelda for NES. You're armed with nothing more than your own tears at first, and have to cry your enemies to death. The controls are explained to you in the first room, with no tutorial, and you're off. Following the doors, you might find some room with a crown on it, known as a treasure room. You can gain items to become more powerful. For example, you might get more firerate on your tears, some laser you can fire instead of tears, you might upgrade your damage, or even your HP. Speaking of HP, when you first play, Isaac will start out with three hearts. On hit, your health goes down, obviously. Red hearts replenish health. However, you can earn blue hearts, and these blue hearts can go ABOVE your max health. However, once you lose them, these soul hearts, they're gone. Anyhow, throughout more exploration, you might find a dark, ominous-looking door. This is the boss room, where you fight the boss of the floor, and after it's defeated, you move on to the next floor. However, if you die, it's back to the beginning with you. A very true rogue-like game. I'll leave the rest for you to figure out, granted you purchase this game.  Anything extra: The soundtrack. Nothing much more to say than it's amazing. Yeah. Also, this game is NOT for the weak of stomach, for there is a LOT of blood/gore.  Final remarks: Overall, The Binding of Isaac is a VERY fun, and enjoyable game. Death happens a ton, and you're going to get used to it.

"  When I started Terraria I was on the Mobile version, and that was outstanding. I played until I got as far as I could, and then started trying to collect all the Mobile version items, while trying to build an amazing house. Then my dad got me this version, and it's definitely the most amazing game I have ever played, and it's DEFINITELY worth the $10. I would pay $50 if I had to. People will say that this is a rip-off of Minecraft, but really the only similarities are that they're both blocky sandbox games. I personally think that Terraria is amazing, and I will make a list of all the pros and cons here:  Pros: Over 3K items Very creative enemies, items, and even biomes Over 12 bosses Runs with almost no lag, only when you've modded the game a TON You can do almost anything with all of the creative and unique items and enemies Even though it's 2D, you can build almost anything. Two seperate modes, one more challenging but more rewarding and has it's own exclusive items Offers many challenges that give you exciting and happy moments when you overcome them Very customizable settings, and even your cursor and character! Tons of amazing mods to get (Yes, you can mod it, and it's way easier to mod than Minecraft) Pretty good community most of the time Amazing soundtracks Over 500 enemies (Which includes version specific enemies if you're looking for Terraria for another type of device) Great lighting Multiple character modes to choose Most Terraria servers like Pedguin's are pretty amazing  Cons: Forums are mostly 'plz join me' or 'who wants free items' Game is 2D (Although that's actually a pro in some ways) At certain times progression can be extremely difficult (although that makes it even more exciting to get past these moments) Worldgen can be a troll sometimes Rng (Random Number Generator, aka enemy drop rates/spawn rates) can also be a troll sometimes  That's all I can think of right now, although there's probably more pros and cons. But yeah, this is definitely the best game I have ever played, 5/5, maybe even 6/5.",1,started terraria mobile version outstanding played got far could started trying collect mobile version items trying build amazing house dad got version definitely amazing game ever played definitely worth would pay people say ripoff minecraft really similarities theyre blocky sandbox games personally think terraria amazing make list pros cons pros k items creative enemies items even biomes bosses runs almost lag youve modded game ton almost anything creative unique items enemies even though build almost anything two seperate modes one challenging rewarding exclusive items offers many challenges give exciting happy moments overcome customizable settings even cursor character tons amazing mods get yes mod way easier mod minecraft pretty good community time amazing soundtracks enemies includes version specific enemies youre looking terraria another type device great lighting multiple character modes choose terraria servers like pedguins pretty amazing cons forums mostly plz join wants free items game although thats actually pro ways certain times progression extremely difficult although makes even exciting get past moments worldgen troll sometimes rng random number generator aka enemy drop ratesspawn rates also troll sometimes thats think right although theres probably pros cons yeah definitely best game ever played maybe even

One of the most helarious tower defence games I’ve played. I do very much enjoy this genre and orcs must die does shine as one of the best. Even though the gore and the graphics design is 'cartoony'; mowing down the hord with well placed traps or jumping into the frey with a meele weapon is still extremely satisfying. The humor is well done but taylored for younger players with reasonably subtle hints to more adult subjects. The plot is simple but entertaining non the less.

"After beating 5, I remembered that I had never beat GTA 4 all the way. I absolutely devoured 5 and still play it to this day, because it is such an awesome game. However, going backwards and playing 4, I now remember why I didn't beat that one. There is just way too much traveling. Driving in 5 is pretty easy due to there being a lot more straight shots. Driving in 4 is ridiculous because they built the city as a real life city with all these dead ends, weird corners, and just overall, frustrating layout. My biggest peeve is that there is that stupid ♥♥♥ toll booth on one of the bridges. Either you stay in line and pay the toll, or you blaze through it and get a wanted level. Both are inconvenient. Also, the side quests of either dating or hanging out is tedious. 'Let's go to the cabaret!' No, I want to do missions and make money. -1 to your friendship. 'Lets go bowling!' No, I want to do missions and make money. -1 to your relationship. One other thing that they really corrected from 4 to 5, is that whenever you fail a mission in 5, you can replay a part of it. You are right there, back into the thick of the action. In 4, if you die, you start all the way at the beginning. And heaven help you if you need a car to get there because you restart the mission without a vehicle. This game is no longer fun, it feels like work. Games shouldnt feel like work. Also, going backwards has really dulled my thoughts on going back to Red Dead Redemption. I absolutely loved that game, too, and I don't want to do the bit where you re-watch or replay something and it tarnishes the memories you had. Same with why I won't rewatch certain cheesey 80's movies, too many have been spoiled by 'What the hell was I thinking?'",1,beating remembered never beat gta way absolutely devoured still play day awesome game however going backwards playing remember didnt beat one way much traveling driving pretty easy due lot straight shots driving ridiculous built city real life city dead ends weird corners overall frustrating layout biggest peeve stupid toll booth one bridges either stay line pay toll blaze get wanted level inconvenient also side quests either dating hanging tedious lets go cabaret want missions make money friendship lets go bowling want missions make money relationship one thing really corrected whenever fail mission replay part right back thick action die start way beginning heaven help need car get restart mission without vehicle game longer fun feels like work games shouldnt feel like work also going backwards really dulled thoughts going back red dead redemption absolutely loved game dont want bit rewatch replay something tarnishes memories wont rewatch certain cheesey movies many spoiled hell thinking

"Great for its unique gameplay, involving managing tactics for a small team and a great cover system. The art design is also very good. Clearing a room perfectly and silently is a joy, but even when you screw up, the frenetic firefights that result are a superb consolation. I would steer all but the most patient away from 'Realistic' difficulty, only because the game sets you on your own at certain points while simultaneously removing many checkpoints. I'd warn people from the sequel as it has some severe pathfinding issues for teammates that utterly torpedo the gameplay, which is odd considering how solid and unproblematic the pathfinding is in this earlier entry.",1,great unique gameplay involving managing tactics small team great cover system art design also good clearing room perfectly silently joy even screw frenetic firefights result superb consolation would steer patient away realistic difficulty game sets certain points simultaneously removing many checkpoints id warn people sequel severe pathfinding issues teammates utterly torpedo gameplay odd considering solid unproblematic pathfinding earlier entry

You can steal weapons and kill enemies but the game is more about running. I imagine this is what games like Assassin's Creed would look like if they were done in first-person and climbing/free runing wasn't automatic.   The visuals of this game are pretty stunning.

"Great game, I'm going to copy/paste to people who are new to Sonic Games. This is a platform/speed game just so everyone knows. The game's story focuses on Sonic the Hedgehog as he infiltrates a once peaceful, but now mechanized planet. Doctor Eggman, Sonic's nemesis, uses the planet's time travelling properties to make it his own headquarters. He also has Sonic's robotic counterpart Metal Sonic capture Amy Rose. Sonic must travel through time to save Amy, foil Eggman's plans and bring peace back to the world. I will always recommend a Sonic game, except Sonic 06, but that's not the point, now isn't it? Anyways, to get the good ending, (For people who love good endings) go through the past signs, run really fast without getting stopped, go to the past, release the animals in a hidden capsule, go back to future if you wan't, then get around 50 rings or so (optional), go into the giant ring at the goal and try to break all purple capsules before time runs out, slipping in water decreases time, green capsules grant time, and you'll earn the time stone. To get the not as good ending (if you don't really care and just wan't to play the game), just get through the levels. Basically, I recommend this game to anyone, I won't mind if you don't wan't the game, but it seems like you would be missing out if it's a no.",1,great game im going copypaste people new sonic games platformspeed game everyone knows games story focuses sonic hedgehog infiltrates peaceful mechanized planet doctor eggman sonics nemesis uses planets time travelling properties make headquarters also sonics robotic counterpart metal sonic capture amy rose sonic must travel time save amy foil eggmans plans bring peace back world always recommend sonic game except sonic thats point isnt anyways get good ending people love good endings go past signs run really fast without getting stopped go past release animals hidden capsule go back future want get around rings optional go giant ring goal try break purple capsules time runs slipping water decreases time green capsules grant time youll earn time stone get good ending dont really care want play game get levels basically recommend game anyone wont mind dont want game seems like would missing

"I've spent almost 500 hours on this game at thus point so, yeah, recommended.   It’s a very good game. I do have some criticism though. There is no end game. This probably will not bother most people but there is my next criticism.  Hard mode is a ♥♥♥♥♥; after you kill the Wall of Flesh you activate hard mode in which a new biome is created (the hallow), a new corruption biome and the two biomes spread. My suggestion is before you kill the Wall of Flesh build a massive floating island, move your NPC’s to the floating island you made and give the world below to the corruption and hallow.  Lastly, sense the update it has been very easy to get money. In my current play through I have so much money it is ridiculous.   One of the criticism this game often gets is “It’s just Minecraft in 2d,” which is not true. It is easy to come to that conclusion if you’ve seen or played only 10 minutes of it but it is very different. Yes it involves mining and crafting but Terraria focuses a lot more on combat and exploration while Minecraft is about crafting (mostly).",1,ive spent almost hours game thus point yeah recommended good game criticism though end game probably bother people next criticism hard mode kill wall flesh activate hard mode new biome created hallow new corruption biome two biomes spread suggestion kill wall flesh build massive floating island move npcs floating island made give world corruption hallow lastly sense update easy get money current play much money ridiculous one criticism game often gets minecraft true easy come conclusion youve seen played minutes different yes involves mining crafting terraria focuses lot combat exploration minecraft crafting mostly

"Wow, this game. If you haven't been bombarded with it's praises already at some point in oyur life you my friend have been living under a turn-based strategy void rock, this game is brilliant. I could recommend it to you all bloody day if i wanted to. With its brilliant graphics, interesting story line (though that may be its weakest point) and sensational turn-based strategy suspenseful gameplay that will have you crying for days over one of your soldiers that you could have saved had you noticed that Floater on the left of the screen. WHY DAMMIT WHY THEY WERE SO YOUNG SO YOUNG. Ahem. This game will be forever immortalised as one of the greatest turn-based strategy, scrap that one of THE best stratedy games of all time. Don't just ask me, I'm sure there are a billion other reviews out there just like this one! But do you know what there isn't anything else quite like? This game... this bloody masterpiece. Welp, im fanboying a bit now but in all seriousness, if you love a good permadeath turn-based strategy game then do yourself a favour and give this one a try, and if you like it XCOM:2 is scheduled for release Feb 2016. That'll be a great self-bought birthday present for me hehe To conclude, like many others, this game sits firmly in my Top 5 of all time, but don't let me decide for you.

"XCom was my favorite game growing up. I even enjoyed Terror from the Deep, which everyone seemed to hate.  This version is good.... REALLY GOOD. Dare I say better than the original. It's definitely more playable and missions are quicker and more fun.  I did find the number of weapons a bit limiting. But add the 'Enemy Within' expansion pack and it opens up the game even more.  I recommend Ironman mode where your game is continually saved. Choices become more meaningful when you can't just reload if you miss a shot or your favorite operative dies.   Overall, the game is awesome. Easy to see why it won so many awards. Two big thumbs up!! 95%   ",1,xcom favorite game growing even enjoyed terror deep everyone seemed hate version good really good dare say better original definitely playable missions quicker fun find number weapons bit limiting add enemy within expansion pack opens game even recommend ironman mode game continually saved choices become meaningful cant reload miss shot favorite operative dies overall game awesome easy see many awards two big thumbs

"Total Score: 62/100 C+ (Maximum Mediocrity!)  Graphics and Art: 9 Sound and Music: 7 Story and Plot: 2 Controls: 8 Creativity and Uniqueness: 2 Mood and Immersion: 6 Length, Content, and Replayability: 7 Functionality: 9 Character Choice and Customization: 5 Challenge: 7  Crysis is to games what, say, Transformers or Armagheddon are to movies. It's clean, looks good, nice effects, high budget, and you won't remember it in a week or two. There is, however, for a first-person shooter, a single kinda-neat thing. There really are a variety of ways to work through the game. You can sneak past all the enemies, kill all the enemies, use ambient vehicles (or not, for the most part), etc. And, to be honest, I'm not entirely sure the 'being able to sneak past all the enemies' thing is intended or not, but with something this, relatively speaking for FPSs, open ended, the developers had to know that all sorts of solutions would be possible. I found the game to be almost entirely bug-free except for a single time I found the enemies to be unkillable, reloaded, and it was fixed. The story, is, well, really, really bad: predictable, cliche, uninteresting, and cringe-worthy (oh, so much cringe). I didn't care about any of the protagonists or antagonists for that matter. I kind of thought it would be a mercy for the aliens to destroy this mundane, boring version of Earth. Also, the North Koreans are, once again, the completely unrealistic antagonists (the Korean translaton of what they are saying is, maybe, 'Get that guy! Maybe he has a sandwich!'), mostly because every other nation on Earth was involved in production and marketing, as you can see in the credits (the dubious reward for game completion). It would be far better and less immersion-breaking to, just, make up an alternate world where this is happening or, say, create a new country in the future unrelated to real-world geo-politics, but that's just me. But, then again, that requires creativity, and it's impossible to mass-produce creativity. With such a bad story, what's another unrealistic, tropish plot point? Man, I said a lot of bad things, but this is actually a fun game, despite the mediocrity. It's fun to blow up tanks or use the various vehicles, or even to sneak around, which is mostly what I did.",1,total score c maximum mediocrity graphics art sound music story plot controls creativity uniqueness mood immersion length content replayability functionality character choice customization challenge crysis games say transformers armagheddon movies clean looks good nice effects high budget wont remember week two however firstperson shooter single kindaneat thing really variety ways work game sneak past enemies kill enemies use ambient vehicles part etc honest im entirely sure able sneak past enemies thing intended something relatively speaking fpss open ended developers know sorts solutions would possible found game almost entirely bugfree except single time found enemies unkillable reloaded fixed story well really really bad predictable cliche uninteresting cringeworthy oh much cringe didnt care protagonists antagonists matter kind thought would mercy aliens destroy mundane boring version earth also north koreans completely unrealistic antagonists korean translaton saying maybe get guy maybe sandwich mostly every nation earth involved production marketing see credits dubious reward game completion would far better less immersionbreaking make alternate world happening say create new country future unrelated realworld geopolitics thats requires creativity impossible massproduce creativity bad story whats another unrealistic tropish plot point man said lot bad things actually fun game despite mediocrity fun blow tanks use various vehicles even sneak around mostly

The game went from amazing, to really ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. They not only added a ton of new content, but also changed the way the game is played, FOR THE BETTER! Although the Wiki is slow to update, I kinda knew what the new items, new actions and new areas were meant to do. Tons, and I mean TONS of new sprites for Zombies, made me stand outside my house at night just to see them all. Rain was also added. This added a whole new feel to the game. There are 2 types of rain, light and heavy. Light you can still enjoy your adventure, going off and fighting slimes, the 'Eye', Skeletron, you will still enjoy adventuring. When it's Heavy however, It counts as night. The world is darker than dark. Zombies(in raincoats), Smiles(with cute little umbrellas) FLYING FISH?!? All come out and try to ♥♥♥♥ you.

"Fun game, the way you can kill or capture enemies is done in a cool way. Same goes for the ammo you collect; you use creatures instead of bullets. How awesome is that ? The game has an open world feel to it, but it's not. It just gives you the illusion that it is. Anyway, you do quests and they mostly end up with you having to capture or kill a boss, along with their henchman.  This is a port from the Xbox version but all things considered, it still looks pretty good. Sound is also good and as you can tell the gameplay is still nice and fresh. By the way, the company that released this version will also release a HD patch later this year, so things will definately look sharper then (and, if I recall correctly, models will also be updated). But I recommend you buy it, HD patch or not.

You can steal files, change your identity, change OTHERS identities, fake Social Security Numbers, create a virus, and SO much more.

"As a huge FPS fan while being disappointed with most modern FPS games, this game does a really good job of being a good FPS in modern gaming for the genre. Sure it has some modern mechanics and elements I don't like, but not enough to outweigh the good points and aspect of how the game is made.  I am also a huge Wolfenstein fan and while I like most of the series to the same degree, I still feel this one is most likely the best of the series in the sense of being a 'Wolfenstein game' goes.  Pros: 1) Graphics are pretty great despite being on the sh*tty idtech 5 engine with the sh*tty megatextures which do sometimes become an issue, but not as much as other idtech5 games 2) The story is pretty good (despite playing as the bad guys) and the whole 'story-driven' FPS that would maybe seem like an oxymoron is really well done in this game, it has some very good writing with its dialogue as well 3) Gunplay is pretty satisfying 4) Game gives a wonderful view of how great and beautiful our world would be if the bad guys had not won WW2 :^) Cons: 1) You play as the bad guy/side of history 2) Game forces you to kill people of a good and great civilization 3) There is no cameo of the greatest man who ever lived in this game (real big con imo) ",1,huge fps fan disappointed modern fps games game really good job good fps modern gaming genre sure modern mechanics elements dont like enough outweigh good points aspect game made also huge wolfenstein fan like series degree still feel one likely best series sense wolfenstein game goes pros graphics pretty great despite shtty idtech engine shtty megatextures sometimes become issue much idtech games story pretty good despite playing bad guys whole storydriven fps would maybe seem like oxymoron really well done game good writing dialogue well gunplay pretty satisfying game gives wonderful view great beautiful world would bad guys ww cons play bad guyside history game forces kill people good great civilization cameo greatest man ever lived game real big con imo

Top notch combat, lots of side quests, 3 totally different character classes with support for hybrid classes with my favorite being the Jack Of All Trades, Legend Of Dead Kel was one of the best DLC expansions I've played period, and it's a very large expansive world.

"Terraria is game I received on my 14th Birthday from a steam friend during the time I was heavily in to minecraft (Even making a let's play go figure) during that time I did not really enjoy Terraria as it seemed like a 2d rip off Minecraft. Flash forward 4 years to 2015 and my friend buys Terraria after playing it on his PS4, I make a server and we start playing, suddenly eight hours have gone by and we have explored most of the world and defeated two of the many bosses.   Terraria is more complex then minecraft due to the fact that there are more componets than just mining and creating. There are specific goals to set yourself such as defeating the eye of Chtuhlu or mining your way to hell to fight the wall of flesh. This adds a reason to creating a building to store many of the npcs that you will encounter whilst exploring who will then sell you items to aid you on exploring more. This adds a reason to continue playing after you have created a interesting house for your items.   Terraria is definitely a game to play with friends as it seems a bit empty if you are just playing on your own. I highly recommend this game as it's a great game to lose yourself in for a few hours with your friends.",1,terraria game received th birthday steam friend time heavily minecraft even making lets play go figure time really enjoy terraria seemed like rip minecraft flash forward years friend buys terraria playing ps make server start playing suddenly eight hours gone explored world defeated two many bosses terraria complex minecraft due fact componets mining creating specific goals set defeating eye chtuhlu mining way hell fight wall flesh adds reason creating building store many npcs encounter whilst exploring sell items aid exploring adds reason continue playing created interesting house items terraria definitely game play friends seems bit empty playing highly recommend game great game lose hours friends

"Who doesn't like killing Nazis?!  Gameplay:  Good mixture of frustrating yet satisfying. I love that the autosave system saves right before a really frustrating part, although there was at least one instance in which I did have to sit through a cutscene a few times when I would die in the battle afterwards.  Story:  I actually thought this was decent. It's a 'What If' spin on if the Nazis had won WWII. It does take it a bit far in a lot of areas but it is a cool idea, especially for someone like myself who has watched a lot of WWII documentaries and always had that idea in the back of their mind.  Overalll: I'd rate this as a moderately good title, I don't think it's worth the $60 retail price but if, like me, you can get it during a steam sale for 50% or more off then it is definitely worth it! The gameplay did get a bit repetitive in areas but as soon as I started getting bored of having to do the same thing twice it would cut to a cinematic and then you'd be thrown into a new area and the repetitiveness would disappear. The whole advancement system it has is complete bulllshit and I did not use it once during the entire game...I simply didn't understand/care for it and ended up making it through to the end without issue so I didn't care to even discover what it was. That said, this is a game that kept my interest and had me playing daily until I beat it, and that in itself is a rare occurrance these days!",1,doesnt like killing nazis gameplay good mixture frustrating yet satisfying love autosave system saves right really frustrating part although least one instance sit cutscene times would die battle afterwards story actually thought decent spin nazis wwii take bit far lot areas cool idea especially someone like watched lot wwii documentaries always idea back mind overalll id rate moderately good title dont think worth retail price like get steam sale definitely worth gameplay get bit repetitive areas soon started getting bored thing twice would cut cinematic youd thrown new area repetitiveness would disappear whole advancement system complete bulllshit use entire gamei simply didnt understandcare ended making end without issue didnt care even discover said game kept interest playing daily beat rare occurrance days

"One of the best indie surprises i ever had : It's concept is not really new, but at least it's done perfectly right : The graphics, pretty primitive and made out of different images like those arty cardboard montages you did as a kid, still manage to give a truly unreal world and adds it's effect to the whole gravity-manipulating concept. The soundtrack is well, even more primitive as it consists of mainly 2 or 3 beats that repeat all over again, yet it doesn't break anything.The physics system works nicely and it's easy to handle.

"Let me write this coming from a -very- avid Minecraft player's perspective. It's not Minecraft, or anything close. Sure, it has crafting, sure it has building, sure it has 'adventure' and free-will - but so does every game nowadays. Minecraft's core userbase are creative characters with an aptitude for establishing their roots into the ground and sucking every last bit of creativity they can to build monumental or complex buildings and devices. The other side of Minecraft is the suriving aspect - that you live and work as you do in real life, only rewind 200 years.  Terraria is a mix of that last part - surviving with friends - plus an additional drive to gather and hunt. The randomly generated worlds are brilliant, the dungeons are nothing short of extensive, the items and weapons are very unique and the developers have put nothing short of their entire imagination into some. There really doesn't appear to be any limits to what these developers are planning.  I mean, rocket boots?",1,let write coming avid minecraft players perspective minecraft anything close sure crafting sure building sure adventure freewill every game nowadays minecrafts core userbase creative characters aptitude establishing roots ground sucking every last bit creativity build monumental complex buildings devices side minecraft suriving aspect live work real life rewind years terraria mix last part surviving friends plus additional drive gather hunt randomly generated worlds brilliant dungeons nothing short extensive items weapons unique developers put nothing short entire imagination really doesnt appear limits developers planning mean rocket boots

"The Binding of Isaac is a bit of an oddity for me to review. First let me explain the game. You play a character who shoots enemies in his basement with his tears. The levels consist of several interconnected rooms, through which you generally fight a group of gruesome bad guys (zombies, mutant spiders, etc.). You fight through enough of them to get keys or coins, which allow you to open up rooms with upgrades or to buy upgrades. Each floor has a boss fight, after which you'll drop down to the next floor, then repeat the process.   Now let me talk about the difficulty. You will quickly find this game does not mess around. You start off with three hearts. Each hit takes away half a heart; six hits and you're dead. If you die, you go back to the beginning of the game (absolutely no saves). On top of that, you often face multiple enemies who can move faster than you and can shoot projectiles. You also have extremely little recovery time with each hit. You'll need to explore every room to hopefully find powerups or money so you can pay for a little bit of health. Don't expect to find much health throughout each stage, except after bosses. This is easily one of the most difficult games that I've actually still managed to have fun with. Yes, it is frustrating at times, but it never seems unfair. The game plays by a certain set of rules and will always abide by them. There's a certain amount of comfort in knowing that. The enemies on the other hand, they range from mildly annoying to downright evil. But you'll see that for yourself if you buy this game.  The game's aesthetic design is great, the music is great, and the story, while macabre, is pretty interesting. The control is very good and the game is consistent in its dark atmosphere that some would call over-the-top dark humor. The art and level design are, for the most part, pretty simple, but that's okay. The game comes off as cartoony, but I think that contributes to the over-the-top gothic feel. Artistically speaking, it kinds of runs in a similar vein as Salad Fingers.  While the Binding of Isaac is repetitive, there's actually a lot of variety. The game mixes up the bosses, each room is randomly generated with random enemies and random items, and there are a TON of different powerups. While it should feel like you're going through the motions again and again, for some reason it doesn't. The story isn't anything deep, of course, and any semblance of an actual plot is non-existent. You play through a floor, then drop down to the next; wash, rinse, and repeat. It's very similar to Diablo in that fashion. Some people may like that and that's fine, but just know that that's what this game is. While this seemingly meaningless trek initially irked me, I've gotten used to it and now I see the game for what it is. It's not really trying to be something it's not, and as far as original arcade shooters go, this one is probably the best I've ever played. The no-save feature is necessary, I now feel, because it encourages retrying and retrying. It builds skill. The random nature of the game is definitely a plus because you never play through the game with the exact map and enemy placement twice. The game's large amount of variety ensures the game has high replay value.  I've gone back and forth on my opinions with this game. Originally I had mixed feelings because some of the less conventional aspects didn't jibe with my personal preference. However, it is strangely addicting and fun. The difficulty spikes at the fifth floor and gets to (in my opinion) near-impossible levels without mastery. At the moment, the price point ($4.99 for the base game, $2.99 for the DLC) is very good. It's a fun time-waster, especially if you've got a dark sense of humor. Even though I'm not really a fan of arcade shooters, this one sucked me in, and I can't really explain it. As I said before, the art design, music, and controls are all very good, and while the game gets incredibly difficult, it always seems fair. Most importantly, The Binding of Isaac doesn't claim to be something it's not, so it's important to see it for what it is. I've gone back on my mixed feelings and now say that I do recommend this one if you have a dark sense of humor and/or enjoy difficult games.",1,binding isaac bit oddity review first let explain game play character shoots enemies basement tears levels consist several interconnected rooms generally fight group gruesome bad guys zombies mutant spiders etc fight enough get keys coins allow open rooms upgrades buy upgrades floor boss fight youll drop next floor repeat process let talk difficulty quickly find game mess around start three hearts hit takes away half heart six hits youre dead die go back beginning game absolutely saves top often face multiple enemies move faster shoot projectiles also extremely little recovery time hit youll need explore every room hopefully find powerups money pay little bit health dont expect find much health throughout stage except bosses easily one difficult games ive actually still managed fun yes frustrating times never seems unfair game plays certain set rules always abide theres certain amount comfort knowing enemies hand range mildly annoying downright evil youll see buy game games aesthetic design great music great story macabre pretty interesting control good game consistent dark atmosphere would call overthetop dark humor art level design part pretty simple thats okay game comes cartoony think contributes overthetop gothic feel artistically speaking kinds runs similar vein salad fingers binding isaac repetitive theres actually lot variety game mixes bosses room randomly generated random enemies random items ton different powerups feel like youre going motions reason doesnt story isnt anything deep course semblance actual plot nonexistent play floor drop next wash rinse repeat similar diablo fashion people may like thats fine know thats game seemingly meaningless trek initially irked ive gotten used see game really trying something far original arcade shooters go one probably best ive ever played nosave feature necessary feel encourages retrying retrying builds skill random nature game definitely plus never play game exact map enemy placement twice games large amount variety ensures game high replay value ive gone back forth opinions game originally mixed feelings less conventional aspects didnt jibe personal preference however strangely addicting fun difficulty spikes fifth floor gets opinion nearimpossible levels without mastery moment price point base game dlc good fun timewaster especially youve got dark sense humor even though im really fan arcade shooters one sucked cant really explain said art design music controls good game gets incredibly difficult always seems fair importantly binding isaac doesnt claim something important see ive gone back mixed feelings say recommend one dark sense humor andor enjoy difficult games

"If you like offbeat car racing games, Flatout 3 is a game worth buying. It has 9 modes that include all of the old modes such as stuntman and demolition derby, There’s also Monster Trucks, Speed Racing, Off Road, one called Night Shift where you race at night and another that has 50 different challenges. Many more than previous titles in the series.  That said, I was really disappointed with the graphics and vehicle handling. Graphics seem to have taken a retrograde step and handling is much more difficult in Flatout 3. Overall I don’t regret purchasing this title, but it’s not what I expected. If you are familiar with the previous Flatout titles you’ll see what I mean.

"The game itself is fine, but Rockstar seems to have completely rejected this game. As soon as you launch the game, you are prompted with a window asking you to log in to Rockstar Games Social Club. The problem is, it only succesfully logs you in half the time. I have searched for so many solutions and tried so many, yet none of them fully work. Rockstar Support has a page detailing how to fix it, but their 'solution' hardly fixes the problem. All their 'fix' does is removes the need to log in to Social Club to play the game. This may sound fine, but the thing is, you need to be logged in to Social Club to play online. Seeing as one of the selling points of this game is its multiplayer, doesn't it seem somewhat disingenuous of Rockstar to not include a fully functional multiplayer in the game, and instead encourage its players to play offline? At the end of the previously mentioned Rockstar support page, they commented 'We have received an increase in reports starting around 10/4/15 about GTAIV PC Social Club login errors and are investigating the problem now. Please stay tuned to this page for updates.' Ok, so at least Rockstar is looking into it, right? Wrong. They added that to the article on 10/6/15. I gurantee you they could have had this bug fixed much sooner, and you'd be a fool if you believed they were actually going to fix this. The worst part is, this isn't even scratching the surface of the problems with this game. To play online, you'll also need a 'Games for Windows Live account.' Figuring out how to create an account and log in to one in this game was one of the most annoying experiences I've ever had in the menu of a game. I could go on about the problems with this game, but it'll be much easier to summarize. If you only want to play the single player, you should probably buy this when it's on sale. If you want to play the multiplayer, then you're ♥♥♥♥ out of luck. Rockstar has completely rejected this game, and you'll be lucky if you manage to play a couple games of multiplayer.

"My initial review might have been too harsh. What's pertinent is that this game is a relatively simple, 'indie' simulator set in a fish store. What's more, it's literally 'real time'; your fish only spawn / grow in actual days / weeks, meaning if you breed off a set of new and interesting hybrids... it'll be days before you can do anything with them. Some folks appreciate this 'realism', I guess, but it strikes me as an odd choice when everything else (inter-species breeding, 'magic fish', etc.) is completely fictionalized. In the end, it makes for a game that doesn't have a lot of 'bite' to it, and requires relatively large amounts of 'real time' in order to see any kind of progress. Frankly, I can find better ways to watch the hours tick by.",-1,initial review might harsh whats pertinent game relatively simple indie simulator set fish store whats literally real time fish spawn grow actual days weeks meaning breed set new interesting hybrids itll days anything folks appreciate realism guess strikes odd choice everything else interspecies breeding magic fish etc completely fictionalized end makes game doesnt lot bite requires relatively large amounts real time order see kind progress frankly find better ways watch hours tick

"Since I haven't finished the game, this is more of an impression than a full review. But as to why anyone would want to sit through this game is beyond me, since it's about as boring and generic as you can get. The approach to 'horror' here revolves almost entirely around jump scares - and this would maybe be fine if the game weren't trying so hard to be 'scary,' but as is, it just becomes annoying. With the over the top dismemberment and enemy design, the mediocre attempts at 'horror' become so extreme that they lose all potency and just become funny instead.   So, as a horror game, Dead Space is a failure. And as a shooter, it's competent, but the game takes place almost exclusively in dimly lit generic corridors, so it gets boring pretty quickly. The game also has some technical issues on the PC. For example, on my system, switching on VSync introduces a massive amount of input lag and make the game unplayable. Playing a game with VSync off is usually not such a big deal, but since the game is primarily illuminated by flickering lights, screen tear is a pretty big issue.  Honestly, if you're interested in this game and haven't played System Shock 2, go play that instead. It's a much more compelling experience and infinitely more terrifying.",-1,since havent finished game impression full review anyone would want sit game beyond since boring generic get approach horror revolves almost entirely around jump scares would maybe fine game werent trying hard scary becomes annoying top dismemberment enemy design mediocre attempts horror become extreme lose potency become funny instead horror game dead space failure shooter competent game takes place almost exclusively dimly lit generic corridors gets boring pretty quickly game also technical issues pc example system switching vsync introduces massive amount input lag make game unplayable playing game vsync usually big deal since game primarily illuminated flickering lights screen tear pretty big issue honestly youre interested game havent played system shock go play instead much compelling experience infinitely terrifying

"This game is so.. very.. boring. I bought this game because I believed it was a PC version of 'Katamari Damacy', a popular and nice PS 2 game. Sadly it's far from it.

I don't mean an entertaining horror show but, one that makes you rather depressed and rethink whether being alive is all it should be. Every 'living' creature in this game from small pets to human beings makes me wonder if the creators of this game had an interest in taxidermy.

"A sprawling, humorous adventure in the old style, beset by enough problems that it's better to save yourself from the frustration and forget about it. Lots of pretty decent voice acting, even if it's all hammy and silly, but few of the belly laughs of the Monkey Island games they tried to emulate, only with too much heavy sarcasm and not enough absurdity. The graphics are bright and shiny, the characters even occasionally have a bit of real-life spark to them, and there are a hell of a lot of puzzles to solve (plus a few fetch quests). When the occasional hilarious moments clicked, it almost made it all worth it.  My biggest problem with it was the utterly plodding pace everyone shuffled at, and with such a huge world, you could catch a nap walking between areas. With zero in-game tutorial, there was no way to know that a double-click made you run, until a puzzle near the end through was unsolvable if you didn't, so I had to go online and find out that the game screwed me. Combine that with terrible pathing, where you take the longest route and walk in circles to get to anything, and it was a dull, frustrating game. The horrible camera contributes significantly; they tried to make it as cinematic as possible with fixed cameras that turn with you, but half the time that just means you have to click every two seconds to keep walking. Some of the swooping effects are nice, but interfere with gameplay whenever you want to click on something while you're walking. The cinematic experience was kind of broken anyway, when everyone looks off into space while talking to each other and uses the exact same hand gesture.  Compared to that constant irritation, the occasional insane puzzle (or insane chapter, as Amanda's seemed to be), and the expected heaping bugs that every adventure game has weren't as bad. They just meant I ended up leaning on a walkthrough at times to figure out what one thing I'd missed somewhere, and occasionally rage quitting for a few days when it crashed again.  I think I truly came to hate it when I found a good fix, and Jack said, 'No, that would be the obvious solution. I feel like some challenge. Let's try it another way....'  Ultimately, I grimly finished it just because I'd already invested so much time, but it became an endurance that I wouldn't wish on anyone.

"First the good: The character animations and voicing are outstanding and the map designers and texture artists are very good.

Boss battles are tiresome (and I kept having to look up what I needed to do to progress), there were no hooks to make me want to keep playing to see what would happen next, picking up ammo is a key-mashing experience to ensure you pick everything up and guns are rubbish (even if they do have two different firing modes, oh wow amazing).  The only unique thing in this game that made me smile was the laser cutter. It was pretty nice to be able to cut through some sheet metal to get to some place, but when that’s the only new experience a game has to offer, you have to ask yourself if it’s worth playing.  My answer is no. This game is a solid 7/10 – it does nothing wrong but it’s nothing special and in a year’s time you won’t remember any of it. And you won’t care that you don’t remember.",-1,first good character animations voicing outstanding map designers texture artists good ive never seen games cutscenes rendered ingame look good feel realistic unfortunately highpoints dont make wolfenstein worth playing actual gameplay completely lacklustre gunplay weak unfulfilling story pretty stupid unbelievable memorable moments whole game runofthemill nothing special done got tshirt boring whatever reason game lacks magic x factor makes game greater sum parts boss battles tiresome kept look needed progress hooks make want keep playing see would happen next picking ammo keymashing experience ensure pick everything guns rubbish even two different firing modes oh wow amazing unique thing game made smile laser cutter pretty nice able cut sheet metal get place thats new experience game offer ask worth playing answer game solid nothing wrong nothing special years time wont remember wont care dont remember

"So I started out loving this game, back in beta. It was fresh, it was exciting, it does things no other title on the market does, like skiing. A breath of fresh air, a new arcade shooter. But once you get past the initial fun, the flaws start showing up.  Physics are crap: it claims 'worlds fastest shooter,' but only in pure speed going in a slightly curved line. It's anything but fast-paced due to low gravity and weak jetpacks/acceleration (at full energy, you can't recover if you step off a platform and fall 3 feet). The effect is as though you're playing underwater.  Automatic weapons are dominant because of this lack of mobility: in a game that has little emphasis on cover, they're not fun or skillful, and 8/10 aren't even needed. This problem is compounded by the fact that bullet hitboxes -for some reason- are larger than 1-shot projectile hitboxes. Even after nerfs, they're still almost double the DPS of explosives and have no spread to curb them.  See comments for rest of rant.",-1,started loving game back beta fresh exciting things title market like skiing breath fresh air new arcade shooter get past initial fun flaws start showing physics crap claims worlds fastest shooter pure speed going slightly curved line anything fastpaced due low gravity weak jetpacksacceleration full energy cant recover step platform fall feet effect though youre playing underwater automatic weapons dominant lack mobility game little emphasis cover theyre fun skillful arent even needed problem compounded fact bullet hitboxes reason larger shot projectile hitboxes even nerfs theyre still almost double dps explosives spread curb see comments rest rant

"I'm not leaving a bad review because the game itself is bad. In fact the game is great. My problem is that if you are like me and don't have the time to sit in a vent channel waiting for an interview with an admin JUST so you can play on one of the very few populated servers, then you aren't going to have very much fun. the game play is great - but there is no room for a player that just wants to hop into a game here or there. And then theres the fact that if you arent interested in playing one of the mods, then your server options are limited even farther. at the exact moment of writing this review, there are currently 4 public servers with more than 10 players on them. 2 of those four are mods. all 4 require you to register on their site, and then request an interview in their vent or TS server.   When i bought this game that's exactly what i wanted, a game. but trying to play on any of the servers i feel like i am attempting to find a second job. its just not worth the effort to play multiplayer.  Then lets get into the incredibly poor engine that BI has been putting bandaids on since arma 2. its so CPU bound, i feel like im playing games from the DX7 era. It also has all the bugs from arma 2 (do they even try to fix anything?) as well as a ton of new ones but remember! this is arma! bugs are features in disguise! the odds of you getting a solid frame rate over 30fps are pretty much nonexistant. It literally runs everything through the CPU outside of filters, and makes so few draw calls its laughable. DX12 will not fix this either as its not an API issue so we will likely see exactly the same performance as we do now but with more foliage in the upcoming expansion unless they are trying to slip the Enfusion engine in on us as a surprise (not even possible).   TL;DR: the game is fun when you can find servers, as long as you can handle watching a slide show and falling through everything.",-1,im leaving bad review game bad fact game great problem like dont time sit vent channel waiting interview admin play one populated servers arent going much fun game play great room player wants hop game theres fact arent interested playing one mods server options limited even farther exact moment writing review currently public servers players four mods require register site request interview vent ts server bought game thats exactly wanted game trying play servers feel like attempting find second job worth effort play multiplayer lets get incredibly poor engine bi putting bandaids since arma cpu bound feel like im playing games dx era also bugs arma even try fix anything well ton new ones remember arma bugs features disguise odds getting solid frame rate fps pretty much nonexistant literally runs everything cpu outside filters makes draw calls laughable dx fix either api issue likely see exactly performance foliage upcoming expansion unless trying slip enfusion engine us surprise even possible tldr game fun find servers long handle watching slide show falling everything

"An FPS released in 2008 and seems dated even for then.  You're a thief hired to open Pandora's Box. Apparently, you've never heard of it before...  Anyway, as expected all hell breaks loose. Mythical monsters roam the planet destroying mankind. (Weak werewolves, regular were wolves, griffons, golems, fire things, mintoaurs, and some bug things.) Now you have to find a way to reseal the box.  Game play is very meh. There are oddly long stretches between fights throughout the game. Your weapon choices are very limited and as pointed out earlier, there isn't a large variety in enemies. Also, I've gone through every possible thing you can do in the game yet Steam shows me as having only played 12 hours.  The bad part of that is it includes all the time I had it paused and at least an hour of troubleshooting.  Why was I troubleshooting? Because there is a game killing bug right at the end of the game that the developer never cared about fixing. Getting around it requires some forum searches, some file editing, and possibly installing FRAPS (that fixed it for me).  So yeah, there's a bug at the end that many people hit, and was never fixed, that literally stopped your progress cold. For me, that's unforgivable, even if the rest of the game wasn't blah.

"This game is quite boring, its got possibly the worst voice acting/narating i have ever heard, it sounds like a british computer reading each work individually and not reacting or showing emotion to anything around them, the criminal cases are boring and repetitive and lack any kind of story e.g criminals are using karts to steal by driving them in alley ways and small places cars cant reach so race against them and take them down but guess what there are no alley ways or small places they just drive on the same old road as every other mission. Basic idea of missions is to either ram into something until it dead or go to some check point, no story, no cool car customization, no cool new map area nothing just same old cutscene of computer talking followed by driving. Other problems with this game include poor map design e.g went to drive through dark tunnel where other cars were driving, turned out the 'darkness' was in fact a solid cube blocking you from using the tunnel and completely destroyed my car, To many cases at once, so basically there are a set of cases for which you can complete and unlock new cases unfortunatly you have to enter free roam mode and wander around until someone goes hey your near a case and automatically starts you in it and since they have such weak storylines you end up completeing multiple storylines at once and they end up making no sense but luckily the gameplay is so repetive you easily complete them all.  Pros: Graphics Driving Controls  Cons: Repetitive Poor Map Design Lack of unique vehicles Lack of storyline Bad voice acting/Naration Buggy Annoying Cutscenes that can rarely be skipped Bad damage reactions/Animation e.g hit wall both front wheels fly across the map, AI hits wall, small dent apears on their door.",-1,game quite boring got possibly worst voice actingnarating ever heard sounds like british computer reading work individually reacting showing emotion anything around criminal cases boring repetitive lack kind story eg criminals using karts steal driving alley ways small places cars cant reach race take guess alley ways small places drive old road every mission basic idea missions either ram something dead go check point story cool car customization cool new map area nothing old cutscene computer talking followed driving problems game include poor map design eg went drive dark tunnel cars driving turned darkness fact solid cube blocking using tunnel completely destroyed car many cases basically set cases complete unlock new cases unfortunatly enter free roam mode wander around someone goes hey near case automatically starts since weak storylines end completeing multiple storylines end making sense luckily gameplay repetive easily complete pros graphics driving controls cons repetitive poor map design lack unique vehicles lack storyline bad voice actingnaration buggy annoying cutscenes rarely skipped bad damage reactionsanimation eg hit wall front wheels fly across map ai hits wall small dent apears door

"Zero Gear is a cart combat multiplayer online party game. Its more than eight player racing, the maps have a variety of objectives such as three-on-three European and American football. There are battle modes such as using boxing gloves to knock other cars over the edge of a sumo ring into the abyss below. Other maps are skeeball and even a pachinko machine with your cars. Its a true party game for anyone that has seven other friends online with this budget game. The game does offer a four pack for the price of two, which is always incentive. If you have no friends, the real problem is that five years after its release, there is no one playing.  The game plays easy with an accelerator, a nitro boost, a mini jump for sharper turns. You can gain nitro by drafting behind other competitors or touching a floating dreidel. In fact almost touching it is good enough. The boost will put you at your top speed in an instant rather than slowly increasing speed or shooting you forward, so its just as useful to use the boost when you've got the minimum or maximum amount. In other words, just hold down that boost button. If you ever fall off a track or stray too far from the path, you can use a respawn button. There is optional full mouse camera support and even a free aim button so you can target another competitor.  Like all cart combat games you have weapons. In this case there are two buttons to use a weapon in front or behind you. Its shallow in term of weapon variety and you get them by driving through hovering boxes. There is a bubble shield, a boxing glove, a pink love robot that will follow and then hug on the nearest driver until it explodes. You can also get a mine to drop, and a tornado that will throw anyone caught in its winds. Ice blocks will freeze an enemy and send them gliding forward with no ability to turn. Even frozen in ice, their tires will spin, so that feels like an overlooked detail.  Perhaps the most context sensitive item to use is the spring that lets you jump. While the spring can be used to jump over things, I consider this to be more useful for doing backflips and barrel rolls to get more boost. When you're in the air with any jump, you have full tilt control of your vehicle.  If you're all alone you can play with bots, but victories feel hollow without a single player campaign or cup of any sort. You can setup quick matches and assign the fifteen events you want to play. With the quick matches its just you and three other bots playing the same even twice for whatever reason before you progress to the next map. You can always setup a more complex server, but it takes a bit longer.  In terms of customization, you have a lot to chose from. Your car, your gear, your helmet and your face wear. Everything is customization and adds a lot of silly character to the game to make you stand out from the pack online. You can be a hovering brain wearing a clown nose with blonde pig tails driving a boat car. A nice option is randomization, so you can end up with a pink squid wearing a moon helmet driving a bomb with spike tires. Speaking of spike tires, when you use them, you can tell if you let off the accelerator the tires stop completely even if you continue to move forward.  As for the tracks themselves, the races are all closed circuits with only two or three laps. The shortest course has eight laps, but it feels like a strict circle.The driving surfaces are needlessly wide so the focus is more on the weapons instead of the driving skill. Each course has a few ramps and jumps here and there. You'll even go down a bumpy ski slope, a wavy slide and a water slide. Each course is bright and colorful. Its all very appealing to the eyes to make that quick fun joy ride feeling.  There's a lot of creativity with the courses, a pool and water slide, driving on a billiard tapble that connects to an air hockey course. Even the standard race track circuit shows a lot of flair. The desert themed track has you racing outside and then through a crystal mine across wooden roads. The creativity and effort shows, but the thing that holds the design back in my eyes are the lack of hazards. There's a dirt stadium that could use some slowing mud. These wide tracks just need something else on them like a shallow river. The water park has a lot of water, but it has no affect on you even if the water slide can rotate you backward as you go down..  Then there are quirky events such as the basketball, American and European football events that have you trying to score a goal with a gigantic sports ball. While I like the idea, the practice of it in Zero Gear is lacking, its dull and imprecise. Speaking of dull, nothing can trump the tag chase event in terms of boredom. The tag chase has a timer where only one person's time increases. The one that fills their meter first wins the event. Well this takes forever, because everyone else's meter goes down. To make things interesting, the mode will change where the one that is it will decrease in time, making a long mode even longer. These cars are so tiny on such an open wide map that its tough to tag anyone. If the person that's it falls off the level, its up for grabs in the center again.  While a lot of the other events are fun and unique, they feel thrown together such as the pachinko and skeeball games. These are simple games based on points. You use your car to drive off a cliff or ramp and fall down into the pachinko or fly into the skeeball. The skeeball feels like skill, the pachinko feels like dumb luck. This is strictly filler content to flaunt as a frill.  There is controller support, just not in the menus. Default controls needed to be adjusted because some of the buttons were forgotten about. Even adjusting the controls, there is no menu button to adjust, so there's no pause with a controller. In fact there is no pause, because an online game keeps going even with bots. Instead there's a menu with no way to rebind the menu.  Zero Gear feels like it can benefit from from better events and a single player series of races against more intelligent opponents. There is something good here, but it needs to go deeper and bigger. More weapons, more races, more hazards. I'm sure it was fun when its multiplayer was still alive, but with such a small budget game, I wonder how alive it ever was. The game lives and dies on its multiplayer. Judging from the 25% of people with the first achievement, people went into the game, saw that its multiplayer only and went right back out.",-1,zero gear cart combat multiplayer online party game eight player racing maps variety objectives threeonthree european american football battle modes using boxing gloves knock cars edge sumo ring abyss maps skeeball even pachinko machine cars true party game anyone seven friends online budget game game offer four pack price two always incentive friends real problem five years release one playing game plays easy accelerator nitro boost mini jump sharper turns gain nitro drafting behind competitors touching floating dreidel fact almost touching good enough boost put top speed instant rather slowly increasing speed shooting forward useful use boost youve got minimum maximum amount words hold boost button ever fall track stray far path use respawn button optional full mouse camera support even free aim button target another competitor like cart combat games weapons case two buttons use weapon front behind shallow term weapon variety get driving hovering boxes bubble shield boxing glove pink love robot follow hug nearest driver explodes also get mine drop tornado throw anyone caught winds ice blocks freeze enemy send gliding forward ability turn even frozen ice tires spin feels like overlooked detail perhaps context sensitive item use spring lets jump spring used jump things consider useful backflips barrel rolls get boost youre air jump full tilt control vehicle youre alone play bots victories feel hollow without single player campaign cup sort setup quick matches assign fifteen events want play quick matches three bots playing even twice whatever reason progress next map always setup complex server takes bit longer terms customization lot chose car gear helmet face wear everything customization adds lot silly character game make stand pack online hovering brain wearing clown nose blonde pig tails driving boat car nice option randomization end pink squid wearing moon helmet driving bomb spike tires speaking spike tires use tell let accelerator tires stop completely even continue move forward tracks races closed circuits two three laps shortest course eight laps feels like strict circlethe driving surfaces needlessly wide focus weapons instead driving skill course ramps jumps youll even go bumpy ski slope wavy slide water slide course bright colorful appealing eyes make quick fun joy ride feeling theres lot creativity courses pool water slide driving billiard tapble connects air hockey course even standard race track circuit shows lot flair desert themed track racing outside crystal mine across wooden roads creativity effort shows thing holds design back eyes lack hazards theres dirt stadium could use slowing mud wide tracks need something else like shallow river water park lot water affect even water slide rotate backward go quirky events basketball american european football events trying score goal gigantic sports ball like idea practice zero gear lacking dull imprecise speaking dull nothing trump tag chase event terms boredom tag chase timer one persons time increases one fills meter first wins event well takes forever everyone elses meter goes make things interesting mode change one decrease time making long mode even longer cars tiny open wide map tough tag anyone person thats falls level grabs center lot events fun unique feel thrown together pachinko skeeball games simple games based points use car drive cliff ramp fall pachinko fly skeeball skeeball feels like skill pachinko feels like dumb luck strictly filler content flaunt frill controller support menus default controls needed adjusted buttons forgotten even adjusting controls menu button adjust theres pause controller fact pause online game keeps going even bots instead theres menu way rebind menu zero gear feels like benefit better events single player series races intelligent opponents something good needs go deeper bigger weapons races hazards im sure fun multiplayer still alive small budget game wonder alive ever game lives dies multiplayer judging people first achievement people went game saw multiplayer went right back

The allies die insta, or I have to keep them out of the fight, it's tedious. Yet the game forces you to bring them, and gameplay stops any time you need to switch a weapon (which doesn't always work), or use 'abilities' that either have no effect, or fail because they need to be lined up - in which case you're getting shot to death. It's frustraing.   The AI is garbage is hell. I know, I KNOW this game is old. I'd love to compare it to other old ♥♥♥ games which did better - but I know that's not fair.

"Insecticide Part 1. More like Insecticide Part 1 and never get to see Part 2. It's not the developer's fault in that regard, as Part 2 was cancelled.   The first problem is that this is a flippin' Nintendo DS port. It clearly shows, as it's a combination of poorly done shooting, platforming, and point and click. There is not much for any type of help in the game (the 2nd mission took me the longest, with the final taking me the second longest due to lack of telling me what to do other than a vague sentence).  The controls were awkward, the difficulty was random if it was Easy or Hard. The FMV sequences were also horribly compressed compared to in-game mission audio.

Next to every game i love from Abes oddysse to exoddus to strangers wrath they are all absolutely brilliant games (With my favourite being Exoddus) that i have played the hell out of, but saying that even though i really tried with this one i just think Munchs oddysee is a bad game.Not the worst but was just bad.  It didn't look that great astetically all looking rather generic, the control i found to be way too sensitive with no natural progression behind it when doing tight platforming with abe jumping too high and running too fast on the platforms, the puzzles were honeslty kind off pathetic compared to the originals. the music was alright but didn't seem to fit with the game and its look feeling out of place and at times it didn't even feel like a oddworld game as for me a lot of the things that made oddworld what it was was gone.  I will say on a positive note on how the cutscenes and overall story are still enjoyable to witness with great writing and that sometimes the controls actually accomadates the level design, but overall i didn't think it was honestly any good.

"All the bad reviews are true. This game is dreadful. It has poor grainy resolution, horrible voice acting and tormenting ears-piercing background music. Sherlock has an irritating nasal British accent and his remarks are obvious or silly statements, The puzzles are quite easy, but not all of them make sense, and it's easy to miss items. And why make a puzzle game from first person view? It was a bad idea, especially with the oversensitive mouse (obviously, this game was made for mechanical mouses).  And the game crashes, too.

"Gamersfirst, just what is this company? They are a company who 'buys' games from other companies. They are a company who believes that editing out original authors of game developers is okay. Their game known as Fallen Earth is great; however, the Game Masters of the game are corrupt. For the past few years Fallen Earth has been suffering from multiple pvp aimbotters/duplicaters and many more glitchers/exploiters, and what do they GAME MASTERS do? 'NOTHING' They believe that banning innocent players for no reason is the key, accepting bribes from known aimbotters/cheaters and other sources in order for players who are 'legit' get banned. It's wrong and outrageous and I believe that these Game Masters need to get what they deserve 'FIRED'. Tiggs and Dasterd both do this, sure sure, they are well known the gaming community, well maybe they should of thought about this before accepting money to ban legit gamers. Due to this, I give Fallen Earth a +1 for being a good game and a -9 for the Game Masters behavior.

"About an 11-13 hour game on medium. Old game, runs well on modern systems. I think there's a high-res texture pack I used or something? I forget.  Anyway, this game is... alright, but its way, WAY too flawed in some areas to be an enjoyable classic of some sort. Enemy AI is either hyper aware or extremely unaware, usually tending towards the former. Enemy accuracy is a bit ridiculous and since they never run out of ammo, expect an unending steam of rocket launcher pinpoint strikes if you ever decide to eschew the sniper rifle.  Difficulty is a bit whack because it uses the old Health Pack + Armor pickup system, and some enemies can 2-shot you from full health+armor or come in huge groups at the end of the game.  Speaking of, jeez this game is long for an FPS, and the pacing is none too enjoyable either because the events arent interesting. This is probably just my complaint of one of the pitfalls of FPSs, just like random encounters in RPGs. Locations are fairly well designed.  Also, enemies are not hindered in locating you by any object that can be penetrated by a bullet, and they will easily shoot you through canvas walls.  The game suffered no real performance issues which is good (3.2ghz * 6, HD6850, 8gb RAM), controls were customizable with a modern mult-button mouse, and the music was not super memorable and a bit repetative but thankfully not grating. The story is predictable enough, nothing to write home about. Enemies do have convos you can listen in on via your binoculars which adds some atmosphere, but its no Metro 2033.  If you want an older-gen FPS game with some length then by all means, pick this up on a steamsale.",-1,hour game medium old game runs well modern systems think theres highres texture pack used something forget anyway game alright way way flawed areas enjoyable classic sort enemy ai either hyper aware extremely unaware usually tending towards former enemy accuracy bit ridiculous since never run ammo expect unending steam rocket launcher pinpoint strikes ever decide eschew sniper rifle difficulty bit whack uses old health pack armor pickup system enemies shot full healtharmor come huge groups end game speaking jeez game long fps pacing none enjoyable either events arent interesting probably complaint one pitfalls fpss like random encounters rpgs locations fairly well designed also enemies hindered locating object penetrated bullet easily shoot canvas walls game suffered real performance issues good ghz hd gb ram controls customizable modern multbutton mouse music super memorable bit repetative thankfully grating story predictable enough nothing write home enemies convos listen via binoculars adds atmosphere metro want oldergen fps game length means pick steamsale

"Extremely disapointing, I got this game because I had heard a lot of good things about it but the people who recomended it to me failed to mention most of its shortcomings. Weapons feel like they have almost no effect unless you get headshots, missions are extremely repetitive, the lack of a HUD itself is not a problem but making the in-game map extremely screen covering and at the same tie making you have it out to use the telescope for recon makes it a huge pain to scout out gaurd posts due to not being able to see ♥♥♥♥. Stealth does virtually nothing and even if you manage to stealth kill one guy the whole base swarms you immediatly afterwards. The map has nothing interesting in it and enemies are all virtually identical, resulting in exploration being boring and tedious. There is a lack of any rel progression outside of unlocking new weapons, but with a few exceptions they are all slight varitations of the basic assault rifle, shotgun, pistol, and sniper rifle famillies. The malaria management is a pain in the ♥♥♥ and adds nothing but annoyance. There are some good things like the buddy system and fire mechanics but aside from a few good points, the game is largely disapointing.",-1,extremely disapointing got game heard lot good things people recomended failed mention shortcomings weapons feel like almost effect unless get headshots missions extremely repetitive lack hud problem making ingame map extremely screen covering tie making use telescope recon makes huge pain scout gaurd posts due able see stealth virtually nothing even manage stealth kill one guy whole base swarms immediatly afterwards map nothing interesting enemies virtually identical resulting exploration boring tedious lack rel progression outside unlocking new weapons exceptions slight varitations basic assault rifle shotgun pistol sniper rifle famillies malaria management pain adds nothing annoyance good things like buddy system fire mechanics aside good points game largely disapointing

"Since I have not played any of the Fallout games, I will not be making any comparisons to Fallen Earth. After playing this for a while, I thought this is a neat concept, but sadly fely this was a wasted opportunity to make a good mmo. First off, it runs like crap on low end computers and overall it felt really boing after a while. I'm pretty sure there are settings to boost performance, but either way, there really isn't all that much to do besides exploring the environment, which happens to be mostly flat desert until you are able to travel far away from the starting area and crafting weapons. Combat is dull as a sack of bricks so you can forget trying pvp since there is no cover and all I have seen is people dancing around in circles since the range on some of the guns are really short. That pretty much sums up on what I have to say about this game so if you like walikng around looking at terrain with occasional crafting then fine, but otherwise your time is better spent on something else.",-1,since played fallout games making comparisons fallen earth playing thought neat concept sadly fely wasted opportunity make good mmo first runs like crap low end computers overall felt really boing im pretty sure settings boost performance either way really isnt much besides exploring environment happens mostly flat desert able travel far away starting area crafting weapons combat dull sack bricks forget trying pvp since cover seen people dancing around circles since range guns really short pretty much sums say game like walikng around looking terrain occasional crafting fine otherwise time better spent something else

"First of all: what I wanted from this game was a good detective story, not a GTA-like game nor a shooter. The only real positive I can think of is the facial animation, which is really something to behold. As for the negatives:  - The noire atmosphere is terribly hamfisted. It feels like they just watched a bunch of noire movies and took note of all the tropes they could use. The narration is really jarring and uninspired too. - This game is poinltessly open world, and as a result everything looks ugly. - Too many shootouts. You're a detective, not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SWAT. - The logic in the interrogations is all over the place. It constantly switches between demanding you to spot absolute truths (what the witness said is what happened) and relative truths (what the witness said is wrong, but he/she couldn't know), so you never know if the contradictions you just spotted are something you should point out or just irrelevant mistakes. At some points the game forces you to choose between two alternatives that you know are both wrong, and then you are even treated like an idiot because of the 'mistake' you had to make. - Despite all of this the game still finds ways to push you forward even when you made blatant mistakes instead of having you fail and repeat. This makes the whole game feel completely pointless.  Overall I can't find redeeming qualities in this game; I'd rather play most other adventure games.",-1,first wanted game good detective story gtalike game shooter real positive think facial animation really something behold negatives noire atmosphere terribly hamfisted feels like watched bunch noire movies took note tropes could use narration really jarring uninspired game poinltessly open world result everything looks ugly many shootouts youre detective swat logic interrogations place constantly switches demanding spot absolute truths witness said happened relative truths witness said wrong heshe couldnt know never know contradictions spotted something point irrelevant mistakes points game forces choose two alternatives know wrong even treated like idiot mistake make despite game still finds ways push forward even made blatant mistakes instead fail repeat makes whole game feel completely pointless overall cant find redeeming qualities game id rather play adventure games

"This part was written when I had an FX 6300 OCed at 4 Ghz, 8GB ram and an HD 6870: For my current config, look way down below. ------------------------------------------- Operation Flashpoint was good, I bought it three times. Arma was acceptable, I bought it and its addons. Arma 2 was excellent, I bought it twice and I also received it as a gift over Steam.  but frankly, arma 3 is completely disappointing: In 2015-16, Arma series becomes a pay to win with Marksman DLC and APEX addon. In 2035, rocket launchers are utter ♥♥♥♥♥ and the art of guidance systems has been completely lost. In 2035, IFVs are going slower than tanks and flips magically for no reasons. In 2035, your occular implants shows you full screen advertisings for having been a passenger in an helicopter that no one cares about, added in a DLC. In 2035, Weapon zeroing is made en masse over advertised values for ammo (ie: if your ammo is made to leave the muzzle at 800ms and actually leaves it at 920(as for the Katiba). then you will definitely not hit your target beyond 500 meters because it will overshoot it. In 2035, AA rockets are tracking the target as soon as they leave the launcher, good luck if the target is going downward because your rocket will go downward too. In 2035, Westland Lynx are equiped with rockets, not guided missiles. In 2035, the Fennek is an MRAP, but on the plus side, the retractable periscope is funny to use. (Obsolete) In 2035, aircrafts and game engines are so badly designed that even if you have above the recommended specifications, you will have 9 FPS. (Obsolete) In 2035, aircrafts and game engines are so badly designed that even if you have above the recommended specifications, you will have 20 FPS, but the players will teleport all the time, shoot before you see ! Also in 2035, every soldier is the fattest America, Greece, or Iran has to offer and can run for 2 meters provided you are not carrying anything heavy, like a weapon. In 2035, players will be so stupid that you will want to kill them all, even your teammates, because they will join the strongest teams. In 2035, AA radars are the most useless stuff ever created, only usefull for single targets, and on the ground, what happened to the Operation Flashpoint scanner ? In 2035 you will finally be able to go underwater, too bad there is nothing to do there. and finally: in 2035, you can forget about usefull vehicles, here MRAPS do not have AT launchers, and AA tanks have a ridiculously short range, bad accuracy, useless radar, and only 4 rockets which MAY allow you to shoot down one helicopter hovering and not using countermeasures.  In short: the future SUCKS.   for the record I had 976 hours of play time on arma 3 at the time I wrote this (now 1200-ish). This number is still bound to increment, but I can not recommend the game for anyone until they fix their engine, and the future.  Edit: I will be nice for once: The ballistic system is a nice addition to Arma. sorry I ran out of nice things to say. Yet another edit: If modding the game was not such a pain in the ♥♥♥, and if Bohemia did not RELY on modders to make their game for them, I would probably recommend it. Of course that means modding it is a pain in the ♥♥♥ (unless you are creating everything from scratch, which means you can make everything and as such should not bother with this engine) and that I do not recommend it.  A word for JPS2004308 who commented this rant: How does that apply to what I said ? Also I would very much like to point out to everyone here that you copied / pasted your comment to all negative reviews of arma 3.  With an I-5 6600K OCed 4.4Ghz, 16GB ram, SSD drive and an noisy RX 480: -------------------------------------------------------------- At last ! This game runs smoothly (it is way less of a torture to play, jumped from 9 to 70 FPS and my view distance is 7.5km instead of 3km(1km with 19 FPS).  -------------------------------THE APEX RANT: I have to point out if BI wanted *me* to buy the APEX add-on, they should have never dropped those utterly crappy DLCs on the market first. I am sure the new map will be gorgeous and fun to play.  As I said I did not buy it and now the main menu changed, with almost every sub section containing an APEX related link that will *invite you* to buy it. Now if you launch the editor, you will be able to place *APEX UNITS* that you cannot use, which obvioulsy clutters your UI, Same thing about ZEUS. And if you look closely, APEX equipment, even when it is just a retexture of a piece of gear you already have access to (jungle camo version of X weapon), you will not be able to use it, a chasm between APEX and non-APEX in multiplayer, if you want your enemies not to be able to use your weapon, just get APEX. Oh and far worse: two pieces of gear are way tougher than the A3 equipment. If you want to be invincible in multiplayer: Take the Viper helmet (Special purpose helmet of the CSAT) and the Special purpose uniform. those two are way more effective than the former CSAT uniform, to crown it all take a GA Carrier GL Rig, and enjoy your walking tank which is something like 30% more resilient than the former possible walking tank (Defender Helmet + GA carrier rig + CSAT fatigues).  So yes, they are turning the game into a Pay to Win and this since Marksman DLC. ----------------------------------------------------------------- To be honest if you want to really enjoy A3, go find the ACE3 mod first. For some very strange reason they are the ones who, in my opinion, bohemia should hire. Yes, you can stick with ACE2 and arma2 if you are intelligent, but ACE3 corrects a lot of the 'future sucks' I wrote above, it seems though they have decided to not take in account the date of 2035 and stuck with what they know to be currently true. While it seems retrograde, it turns out to be way more futuristic than what bohemia did: At least Titan rockets can make top attacks now. And for those of you who like to be even more of a danger to your teammates, there is a dead man's switch, and the ability to strap explosives on your vehicle (or the enemy's). Also insert here some nice comment about the RHS mod, but to be honest I expected no less from those guys. Go download it instead of buying APEX, it is free and it is good.   -----------------------The 'Did you find this review helpful' rant: Okay so people around find reviews 'not helpful', for some reasons there are more 'unhelpful reviews' not recommending this game than there are recommending it (basically I am pretty sure that if I pressed the 'recommend' button people would find this review more helpful). THINK A BIT you pieces of trash fanboys, what you are doing (Saying 'no') makes negative reviews having more weight than positive ones, the only problem with that being steam forcing people to show only negative reviews to see them.

"This game is about cooking like every other cooking game, but have few points that make it different, mostly in a negative way :   The cooking is not linear  This is somewhat a good addition and quite realistic. If you are cooking a fried rice it is logical if you are able to cut the fishes first, or cut the vegetables first, both should not matter. But both should be cut before frying them. Thus, this game does it quite correct in mixing between linear and progressive when cooking.   Degradation of materials  This is very weird. If you finish a food too fast, you will lose the quality of 'materials' and your food quality, despite excellent cooking, will be reduced to nothing. And to finish your food in their best quality, all foods should be finished at the same time, to prevent 'loss of materials'. Strangely, to keep the materials fresh, all you need to do is chop or grill it. Very illogical. Don't you have some freezer or fridge while you are waiting? Also, which restaurant produce three main course at the same time?  Also, there is no explanation on each dish on what process they should take to finish, so you can time it well. Let's say, dish A requires 8 steps, dish B requires 4 steps. So, what you are going to do is finish dish A 4 steps, then synchronize ending with dish B. But in this game, you rely on blind luck.   Low quality graphics  Even Cooking Mama on Nintendo DS have better quality than this. If you simmer something, you don't 'see' what is added. You don't really feel the vegetables that are put into the pan, or the sauce, or anything. The texture is very bad. I can go hungry after playing Cooking Mama on Nintendo DS, but not on this game.    No Progression  In this game, to progress a level you need to collect 'stars' which is your quality of cooking. The stars could then be used to purchase new recipe. What is the benefit of purchasing new recipe? Nothing. There is no option to upgrade your store, or to put new things into the store, nothing. What's the benefit of getting new recipe? Just a new variation of cooking which you don't see well.

"This is NOT for the casual gamers, sad though coz I was looking forward to it. It is quite complex, the learning curve is quite steep. You've gotta totally invest your time in understanding the mechanics of the game when you get started. Maybe recommended for the hardcore gamers, but for casual gamers, I would say 'avoid'. Not because it is a bad game, but because of its complexity.",-1,casual gamers sad though coz looking forward quite complex learning curve quite steep youve gotta totally invest time understanding mechanics game get started maybe recommended hardcore gamers casual gamers would say avoid bad game complexity

"I like Telltales Game of Thrones, i like Jurassic Park, but this game just is not fun to play. Having puzzles or dialogue choices can be fun but those awfull QTE ( like the Machete-scene) are just there to annoy people. If you like ludicrous QTEs and have no problem with your character dying 50 times in a row or hacking into the same piece of wood with a machete for 25 times straight this might be your game.

"Not recommended, even for people who like a good military simulation game.  Good: - Lots of potential for realism and immersion - Massive variety of ways to interact with game elements  Bad: - Lack of variety in terms of gear (three colours don't make three different items) - Lack of any real weapons: it's all near-future stuff - Gunshots sound too mechanical or like movie sound effects - Weapon animations are loose: effects don't sync up right (two gunshots when you shoot three bullets, etc.) - Vehicles are very difficult to control without dedicated joystick/wheel  VERY Bad: - Needlessly complicated control scheme which will take hours on hours to get used to (literally) - To say the learning curve is steep implies that there is a learning curve - Many functions of the game are hidden, unexplained, unintuitive, or poorly implemented - Potential for realism is destroyed when each mission becomes a sprint between ambushes  There are several different tutorials - some in the 'virtual reality', some on the islands, some as text-only, and none of which are adequate. Each tutorial is about ten-thirty seconds long and involves no actual help, assuming that because you pressed the right buttons once, you now know how to do it in combat. The team seems to have put zero effort into making the game intuitive: you will spend much of your time looking up various controls and reading about methods of interaction.  This game is not finished. If you're looking for a good, intuitive, fun military simulator to get away from the Call of Duty bullcrap, pick up Operation Flashpoint: Red River. It might not be as extensive, and it suffers from a lack of replayability, but it isn't nearly as frustrating as Arma.",-1,recommended even people like good military simulation game good lots potential realism immersion massive variety ways interact game elements bad lack variety terms gear three colours dont make three different items lack real weapons nearfuture stuff gunshots sound mechanical like movie sound effects weapon animations loose effects dont sync right two gunshots shoot three bullets etc vehicles difficult control without dedicated joystickwheel bad needlessly complicated control scheme take hours hours get used literally say learning curve steep implies learning curve many functions game hidden unexplained unintuitive poorly implemented potential realism destroyed mission becomes sprint ambushes several different tutorials virtual reality islands textonly none adequate tutorial tenthirty seconds long involves actual help assuming pressed right buttons know combat team seems put zero effort making game intuitive spend much time looking various controls reading methods interaction game finished youre looking good intuitive fun military simulator get away call duty bullcrap pick operation flashpoint red river might extensive suffers lack replayability isnt nearly frustrating arma

"i played to mutch of this game and i started to hate it after i found out that it was not that i sucked it was the shooting system the game has no head shots or weak points. that showed the reality for pay to win the more you pay for guns with real money the better you are in combat. it's impossible to get good guns for free. and if you get something remotely close to good you are limited to few weeks to own it. you can get free guns that last forever but to get one gun you need to play this for more than 40h and they will still suck (obs. if you see someone with fancy car or cool clothing that you need to fight, you better run). then we are done with guns, now we can go to customization the main thing that the game rubs in your face. Yea it's good but for non members you are limited to specific number of layers on eatch object. the music maker system is pointles couse most music that you can find from community is copies of edm and the samples you get to use sounds like form sega genesis (michael jackson's moon walker Was better than this). the cars just looks like chinese knock off of american and japanese cars. only the little plus isbattle arena wich is bit addictive but will make you angry after finding out the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ wepon system i can't give a good score to this game couse of bad shooting system, good but limited customsation, pay to win system and badly made car models. i give 2/10 (better to download gta sa. with online mod or get gta 5)",-1,played mutch game started hate found sucked shooting system game head shots weak points showed reality pay win pay guns real money better combat impossible get good guns free get something remotely close good limited weeks get free guns last forever get one gun need play h still suck obs see someone fancy car cool clothing need fight better run done guns go customization main thing game rubs face yea good non members limited specific number layers eatch object music maker system pointles couse music find community copies edm samples get use sounds like form sega genesis michael jacksons moon walker better cars looks like chinese knock american japanese cars little plus isbattle arena wich bit addictive make angry finding wepon system cant give good score game couse bad shooting system good limited customsation pay win system badly made car models give better download gta sa online mod get gta
