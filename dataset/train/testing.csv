"Hello COD Fish, lets start by saying I am a Battlefield man myself, but I played all COD's from the first one to the first Modern Warfare. I stopped playing COD because it became too arcade, too hackable, and a new one comes out like every few months so whats the point?  For a prime first person shooter -&gt; Battlefield Bad Company 2 through Battlefield 4 For a good COD game -&gt; COD 4 &amp; COD WaW   I got this game on sale... like most of my games... and it was worth the price. I owned, played, and pwned this game on my seXBOX years ago and thought I would give it another 'shot'! ;P Plus Nazi Zombies is freaking awesome! I just like saying Nazi Zombies, it has a nice ring to it! Lots of people are playing online yet like any COD game most of them are punk kids, but it's still worth it. One of the best WW2 fps I've played. Unfortunatly another reason I got this game was because I had bought Medal of Honor Airborne and it has major graphics issues and I can't play it... so I got this as an alternative.   So yeah I would recommend this game for sure!

I say this is the best call of duty becuase of its more in are time zone than 2130.  Best part of this game is the zombies. playing this with you friends (even the ones that arnt good is still) fun.

This game is AMAZING! The campaign was great and on top of that the custom zombies added a ton more. With custom zombies each map felt like a whole new game. I recommend this game to any big zombies fans or just FPS fans in general. The only problem is that sometimes the custom maps will crash but other than that the game is great. I have a Windows XP and the game runs perfectly so you can run this game on almost any computer.,1,game amazing campaign great top custom zombies added ton custom zombies map felt like whole new game recommend game big zombies fans fps fans general problem sometimes custom maps crash game great windows xp game runs perfectly run game almost computer

"When I was 10 years old I remember my dad getting me this game for Christmas. I remember playing the campaign and enjoying it and being scared by the zombie mode that was unlocked upon finishing the game. During this time I didn't have internet so I couldn't play online. Due to this I always played with my dad. I believe that lasted for a couple months and I begged my dad to get the internet set up so I could play with other people. Call of Duty: World at War was my first online game and it was a great experience.   Campaign: - I would say the campaign in this game is fairly average, but one of the best Call of Duty campaigns. - You can play all, but two missions cooperatively.  Multiplayer: - Personally, I thought this game had the best multiplayer out of all the Call of Duty games. I loved playing Hardcore Headquarters, Hardcore Search and Destroy, and War. - Unfortunetly, this games feels basically dead these days and I don't really see a reason to play it. - On PC there is a problem where you get kicked from games for no reason by Punk Buster.  Zombies: - This game comes with four fun zombie maps upon purchase. - There are loads and loads of custom maps to play - Four player coop.  I honestly can't think of any negative things to say about this game.

"This is What I Think About this Game:  Zombies:  Even though WaW normally comes with 4 zombies maps, you can still play other maps using mods (which are really easy to download &amp; install even if you don't know how), which makes this game way better and provides infinite amount of fun since there are literally billions of maps with tons more being made every day. There are tons of websites that you can visit if you are interested in modding WaW.  Campaign:  I have to admit, the Campaign of World at War is WAY better than the Campaign of Call of Duty: Black Ops 3. Now I know that I might get a lot of hatred for saying that, but if you have played the previous Black Ops games like I have, you would know that those games are masterpieces compared to Black Ops 3. In my personal opinion, this campaign is worth playing and is something you would expect in a Call of Duty game.  Multiplayer:  If you think that this gamemode's servers will be all balanced out and fair, you will be HEAVILY dissapointed. In almost every server, you will most likely be in a server with some kind of hacker who will turn on god mode and troll the **** out of the server until you finally give up and leave the server wishing that they will get banned for life. If I was you, I would play with people I know in a private match so that you won't get to be with hackers.  Overall, this game is something I would heavily recommend to check out.

"The Good: Amazing cinemtic graphics, great sound and voice acting, new weapons, JAPAN!!!, great multiplayer still intact  The Bad: It ends, everything else is still too familiar  Call of Duty is probably THE best WWII FPS series ever made and there are many reasons why. If you rewind back about six years Call of Duty was released on the PC and console gamers envied this exclusivity. CoD offered cinematic game play, great characters, and amazing visuals. At the time Medal of Honor reigned supreme, but not for very long. With Medal of Honor, Brothers in Arms, and Wolfenstein being the top competitive WWII FPS games CoD always remained on top. With each new sequel CoD added better graphics, a more realistic, cinematic experience, and overall great multiplayer. Throughout CoD’s six year life cycle Activision has used many developers to keep the series going strong, and it was also the first WWII series to stray away from WWII and lean towards modern warfare (no pun intended really!). Now that CoD is back on the WWII front line is finally hit the nail on the head and this is what CoD should have been years ago…World at War.  I thank the WWII Gods that listened because we finally for the FIRST FREAKING TIME get to go through the trials and campaign of Japan and not just the bombing of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. The game starts out in the jungles of Japan with banzais rushing after you with bayonets, strange rifles never seen before in a WWII game, amazing visuals (slightly updated Modern Warfare engine to be exact), great enemy AI, and just absolute mayhem. The first thing I noticed were the new weapons. Yes you have the Kar98, MP40, Thompson, BAR, MG42, Springfield, Enfield etc. What I picked up was an Arisaka, a variation of the Kar98, a flamethrower?!, a bayonet?!, the ability to toss mortor heads like genades, molotovs?…insane. I couldn’t believe this. Someone actually added something NEW. Not only are the graphics amazing and extremely cinematic, but the level design is awesome. There are cool sniping missions (think of the one in MW), tank missions (they drive great for once by the way), and missions where you run through Japanese mortor pits and just torch the hell out of EVERYONE. How fun is that? Well, let’s just say it’s so fun you won’t want to use another weapon during those levels.  You don’t just fight in Japan though you also fight on the European front as the Russians over taking the Reichstag all the way to planting the flag yourself. If this isn’t enough to sell you try out the air mission where you’re shooting down Japanese boats and pulling in survivors of the Pearl Harbor bombing on your way back home from Japan. If that’s not exciting enough…oh boy I don’t know what is.  What makes the return to WWII so great isn’t just the new content, or the cinematic game play. Its the detail put into the level design, the characters, the ambiance, the dialog, the voice acting it is all top notch and not even the first CoD had this much detail put into it. After playing WaW you will WANT more WWII games and this is the revival we’ve all been dying for (sorry MoH Airborne was TERRIBLE). If the singly player isn’t enough to sell you how about multi player?  While I didn’t get to try it I was involved in the beta multi player and it was pretty amazing. It’s just like Modern Warfare, but set in WWII instead. There’s plenty of incentive to go back and play the game again thanks to its fair difficulty and amazing visual experience. World at War has so much detail put into it I wouldn’t be surprised to see another MoH, BiA, or Wolfenstein copy any of it. Thank you Treyarch and Activision for reviving this great series…now everyone shut up.  --Score: 8.5/10",1,good amazing cinemtic graphics great sound voice acting new weapons japan great multiplayer still intact bad ends everything else still familiar call duty probably best wwii fps series ever made many reasons rewind back six years call duty released pc console gamers envied exclusivity cod offered cinematic game play great characters amazing visuals time medal honor reigned supreme long medal honor brothers arms wolfenstein top competitive wwii fps games cod always remained top new sequel cod added better graphics realistic cinematic experience overall great multiplayer throughout cods six year life cycle activision used many developers keep series going strong also first wwii series stray away wwii lean towards modern warfare pun intended really cod back wwii front line finally hit nail head cod years agoworld war thank wwii gods listened finally first freaking time get go trials campaign japan bombing pearl harbor hawaii game starts jungles japan banzais rushing bayonets strange rifles never seen wwii game amazing visuals slightly updated modern warfare engine exact great enemy ai absolute mayhem first thing noticed new weapons yes kar mp thompson bar mg springfield enfield etc picked arisaka variation kar flamethrower bayonet ability toss mortor heads like genades molotovsinsane couldnt believe someone actually added something new graphics amazing extremely cinematic level design awesome cool sniping missions think one mw tank missions drive great way missions run japanese mortor pits torch hell everyone fun well lets say fun wont want use another weapon levels dont fight japan though also fight european front russians taking reichstag way planting flag isnt enough sell try air mission youre shooting japanese boats pulling survivors pearl harbor bombing way back home japan thats exciting enoughoh boy dont know makes return wwii great isnt new content cinematic game play detail put level design characters ambiance dialog voice acting top notch even first cod much detail put playing waw want wwii games revival weve dying sorry moh airborne terrible singly player isnt enough sell multi player didnt get try involved beta multi player pretty amazing like modern warfare set wwii instead theres plenty incentive go back play game thanks fair difficulty amazing visual experience world war much detail put wouldnt surprised see another moh bia wolfenstein copy thank treyarch activision reviving great seriesnow everyone shut score

"Early in the single player campaign, I wasn't very happy with this installment. WW2 is a fairly rehashed setting for FPS's and this one felt especially dirty, rough, and generally all around unpleasant as you engage in gruelingly long shooting galleries, get killed over and over by enemies that are coming at you from all directions or that you can barely see amid the foliage.  But after about halfway through, I gained a greater appreciation for what they were going for. Out of all the FPS WW2 treatments, this one seemed willing to rub in your face how miserable the experience was for those who had to endure it, which was a bold direction. The graphics felt dated for what is not a dated game, but now and then they were very impressive, such as in a rainy level at night, where the wet metal/wood surfaces were perfectly textured to make everything look wet.  There is one familiar face from the Black Ops campaign, one of the only memorable Call of Duty characters ever made, so that was also a treat.  Overall, I enjoyed it, though I don't think the gritty, unusually harsh (for a Call of Duty game) solo campaign will appeal to everyone.  I can't speak to any other mode.",1,early single player campaign wasnt happy installment ww fairly rehashed setting fpss one felt especially dirty rough generally around unpleasant engage gruelingly long shooting galleries get killed enemies coming directions barely see amid foliage halfway gained greater appreciation going fps ww treatments one seemed willing rub face miserable experience endure bold direction graphics felt dated dated game impressive rainy level night wet metalwood surfaces perfectly textured make everything look wet one familiar face black ops campaign one memorable call duty characters ever made also treat overall enjoyed though dont think gritty unusually harsh call duty game solo campaign appeal everyone cant speak mode

"Call of Duty: World at war: Nice WW2 game,different than any other FPS i played.The Singleplayer has a nice story,you play from 2 perspectives: as an american and as a soviet,i wish you could play as a wehrmacht soldier too,but still a nice Story. Multiplayer is also pretty good,but as any other CoD it's a bit annoying that there are everywhere annoying players (Pros with OP weapons,Dropshots,Shotgun-only players...) and you pretty much die after getting hit by 5 mp bullets,but i think that's cause moar realism,i mean: not everyone in WW2 had a bullet-proof vest like in modern times (black ops/2,mw2/mw3).

"This is one of the better games in the Call of Duty franchise and introduced the 'Zombies' game mode.  The campaign is fun and followed the traditional Call of Duty story telling with basic character development and was shown as a bit more of a history lesson before a mission begins.  Multiplayer followed the footsteps of Call of Duty 4. This created a fairly balanced multiplayer experience while still giving the player to customize their loadout. This is before custom killstreaks were introduced, which, in my opinion, was the beginning of the end for Call of Duty. It used the 3, 5, 7 killstreak pattern, which was extremely balanced.  This was the first Call of Duty to have zombies. This is where this game really shines. The zombie mode is easily the best part about this game. It offers hours upon hours of enjoyment, not to mention on the PC version you can download countless custom maps. This was the sole reason I purchased this game on PC even though I already owned and enjoyed it on my Xbox 360.  This game gets a solid 8.5/10. The campaign isn't the most enjoyable but good, the multiplayer is fun, and zombies is great.",1,one better games call duty franchise introduced zombies game mode campaign fun followed traditional call duty story telling basic character development shown bit history lesson mission begins multiplayer followed footsteps call duty created fairly balanced multiplayer experience still giving player customize loadout custom killstreaks introduced opinion beginning end call duty used killstreak pattern extremely balanced first call duty zombies game really shines zombie mode easily best part game offers hours upon hours enjoyment mention pc version download countless custom maps sole reason purchased game pc even though already owned enjoyed xbox game gets solid campaign isnt enjoyable good multiplayer fun zombies great

Multiplayer is really why I wanted to write this review. When this game first came out, and it was the 'top' CoD, there was little hackers. Now, there aren't any games where there aren't hackers.

"Personally, I found this game to be one of the best CoD games in the franchise for several reasons.  1. WWII themed I enjoy WWII themed games, and you won't find too many big ones nowadays. CoDs 1-3 were also WWII themed, and I enjoyed them immensely (although I found CoD 1 a little difficult). It seems that the CoD games now are just going further into the 'future', so it's nice to be able to go back in time to get a view (albiet, a somewhat unrealistic one) of WWII. Bayonets: bayonets are great. I don't think any other CoD game allows you to use good ol' fashioned rifle bayonets (Battlefield 1 is coming out in October/November, but that's a different story). Mountable weapons: guns with stands! Didn't really use them much, but they're great  2. The difficulties actually mean something When you pick recruit difficulty, it's really easy, and only designed for begginer players. It's unlikely you're going to die too much on recruit. When playing on hardened and veteran on the other hand, you're probably going to die a lot at certain points (I certainly did. I got around them eventually) but you just have to keep trying out new tactics and looking for new angles. When playing CoD games now, I find that I'm just rolling over the enemies way too easily even on hardened (this might be the product of an increase of small children playing CoD games).   3. Zombies No words should be needed to explain why zombies makes this game even better. This is the original Nazi Zombies game mode we're talking about.   WaW is a nice game that suits my interests, but I have three (but somewhat picky) issues with the game  1. Chokepoints in the campaign missions At some points I found myself stuck at certain points in certain missions, because I had to push up a narrow chokepoint riddled with respawing enemies. I kept dying and dying simply because there was little cover that I could use, and they just kept throwing grenade after grenade after grenade. Namely, 'Burn'em Out' and 'Heart of the Reich'.  Burn'em Out: It's annoying enough trying to get through a tunnel with machine gunners at the end, but a banzai charge WITH grenades? Really? Solution: kill the gunners, trigger the banzai charge, get out of the way. Heart of the Reich: Charging the Reichstag took me way too many tries. Partly from my incompetence, partly from laser-guided Stielhandgranates, and partly from the next issue that I have. Solution: move from cover to cover, and run like hell when a grenade comes rolling down.  2. Awkward checkpoint spawns When you die, you respawn at the last checkpoint. But that last checkpoint might be right smack in the middle of a machine gun nest, and you have to run like dickens while shooting to get out. But the most annoying part is when you reach a chokepoint, struggle right to the end, die, and have to do all of it all over again. I mostly find it annoying because I'm incompetent, and have no skill. Solution: get better at game  3. Laser-guided hand grenades They just get thrown exactly at the spot where I would get killed if I didn't move, but would detonate and kill me if I did try to get out. Solution: throw'em back  These issues are just me nitpicking, and are easily solved by being good at the game.  Highlights (for me) Sniper duel: was great, although took me several tries Bayonetting: BANZAI! Sneaky Japs: those holes in the ground are really cool. You're walking along, and you don't notice the wood covering and surprise! It's a Jap with a bayonet (or a hand grenade) Battling it out in the Reichstag: pretty awesome  Lowlights (for me) Tank mission: I didn't expect one, but there was. And I didn't particulary like it because the controls were awkward, and the enemy tanks were just really tanky puching bags with (seemingly) no armour. That's just me being picky, being a World of Tanks and War Thunder player.  Got this game during the Summer Steam Sale, and was definitely worth my $10.",1,personally found game one best cod games franchise several reasons wwii themed enjoy wwii themed games wont find many big ones nowadays cods also wwii themed enjoyed immensely although found cod little difficult seems cod games going future nice able go back time get view albiet somewhat unrealistic one wwii bayonets bayonets great dont think cod game allows use good ol fashioned rifle bayonets battlefield coming octobernovember thats different story mountable weapons guns stands didnt really use much theyre great difficulties actually mean something pick recruit difficulty really easy designed begginer players unlikely youre going die much recruit playing hardened veteran hand youre probably going die lot certain points certainly got around eventually keep trying new tactics looking new angles playing cod games find im rolling enemies way easily even hardened might product increase small children playing cod games zombies words needed explain zombies makes game even better original nazi zombies game mode talking waw nice game suits interests three somewhat picky issues game chokepoints campaign missions points found stuck certain points certain missions push narrow chokepoint riddled respawing enemies kept dying dying simply little cover could use kept throwing grenade grenade grenade namely burnem heart reich burnem annoying enough trying get tunnel machine gunners end banzai charge grenades really solution kill gunners trigger banzai charge get way heart reich charging reichstag took way many tries partly incompetence partly laserguided stielhandgranates partly next issue solution move cover cover run like hell grenade comes rolling awkward checkpoint spawns die respawn last checkpoint last checkpoint might right smack middle machine gun nest run like dickens shooting get annoying part reach chokepoint struggle right end die mostly find annoying im incompetent skill solution get better game laserguided hand grenades get thrown exactly spot would get killed didnt move would detonate kill try get solution throwem back issues nitpicking easily solved good game highlights sniper duel great although took several tries bayonetting banzai sneaky japs holes ground really cool youre walking along dont notice wood covering surprise jap bayonet hand grenade battling reichstag pretty awesome lowlights tank mission didnt expect one didnt particulary like controls awkward enemy tanks really tanky puching bags seemingly armour thats picky world tanks war thunder player got game summer steam sale definitely worth

Comes with the ability to mod and add replayability I believe. I seen some custom zombie maps on youtube and been looking to get into that, shortly after. The PC community is nice for world at war which surprised me to see a lack of crouch tatical servers, like which plagues black ops 1.

"Tl;dr at bottom for those of you who are lazy. I nominated this game for the 'Test of Time' Steam Award. Why? I remember playing this game back in '08 and '09 at my Friends place. We Played everything from Multiplayer, Zombies, Co-op Campaign, the whole 9 yards. I loved every aspect of it. Once I bought my own Xbox 360, I bought it. I played the ♥♥♥♥ outta it. Lent it to a friend, he broke it. Bought another copy. Once I built my own PC, I bought it, again. And while the multiplayer is on its last leg of population, the zombies mode, solo or with friends, is still amazing. And I'm sure as everyone here knows, The Custom Zombies is where it is at. It is the game I will come back to years from today and still enjoy a good round of zombies.  You want a Pros/Cons List? Easy.  Pros- Almost everything except whats in Cons list.  Cons- Alt-tab is complete ♥♥♥. Mulitplayer is not populated.

"If you're buying this for a single player FPS challenge, go ahead. The game is great if you're looking to get some action shooting out of your system. Zombie mode was pretty good, but without any other players it gets a little boring fast. If you're buying this for multiplayer, DON'T BOTHER! The servers that exist currently are run by tactical 'nazis'. Try running, you'll be kicked or banned for sprinting. Fire into an area without verifying another enemy is there, KICKED! Firing while not crouched and moving forward, KICKED! Throw a grenade in the same structure you're occupying, KICKED! As a matter of fact, try doing anything, and you'll likely be kicked or banned within a few minutes. Especially if you're racking up kills. I never understood why until I started reading the rules they set forth. Although you can do certain things in the game, they will kick you if you do them because you wouldn't 'tactically' do them in real life. They essentially want to play a game that is not CoD. To those a-holes I say go play paintball or airsoft. If you want this for multiplayer, do yourself a favor and buy it for Xbox or PS3. You can't be kicked by petty little tyrants in that environment.",1,youre buying single player fps challenge go ahead game great youre looking get action shooting system zombie mode pretty good without players gets little boring fast youre buying multiplayer dont bother servers exist currently run tactical nazis try running youll kicked banned sprinting fire area without verifying another enemy kicked firing crouched moving forward kicked throw grenade structure youre occupying kicked matter fact try anything youll likely kicked banned within minutes especially youre racking kills never understood started reading rules set forth although certain things game kick wouldnt tactically real life essentially want play game cod aholes say go play paintball airsoft want multiplayer favor buy xbox ps cant kicked petty little tyrants environment

"Call of Duty hasn't sat right with me since 4:Modern Warfare, but World at War grabbed me with it's extreme grittiness.  What makes World at War so special, is how it portrays World War II. Where as past Call of Duty games had light violence, World at War is the only Call of Duty game to feature full on gibbing, as well as bullet impaction gibbing. This and the chilling and scary atmosphere that is all throught the game, makes this the last modern Call of Duty game I've enjoyed ever.  It's Call of Duty, so you shoot opposing soldiers to get to the other end of the map. It's linear, and completely cinematic, but that never really bothered me in this game.

"If you are thinking of purchasing this then it's most likely because you are interested in the Zombies Mode so I will mainly talk about that.   The core 4 maps (which are all free unlike the console version) are all fun but compared to the newer entries they are obviously lacking. It's still an enjoyable arcade-y experience with the core maps being atmospheric and creepy. If you enjoyed maps like Kino der Toten you will probably also enjoy these ones,especially Der Riese (only map with PaP and also the classic catwalk camp spot).  Custom Zombies is the reason you want this game for PC specifically, because the maps you get and gameplay-altering mods like Zombie Realism give you an entirely different experience. There are custom maps that have weapons and perks from the newer COD games like BO2 and buyable endings among other things. The quality of custom maps varies from mapper to mapper and so does the difficulty in each map.  For the best experience a premade group is recommended but I had plenty of fun playing with randoms and the discussion forums have people constantly looking for players to play Custom Zombies with. The game has both LAN and Online but if you are hosting Online you might have to port forward specific ports for this game in order for your server to appear in the server browser.  All in all,buy this on a sale if you are only interested in the Core Zombies and Custom Zombies which are both plenty of fun. 20$ just for Zombies might be a bit too much for some.",1,thinking purchasing likely interested zombies mode mainly talk core maps free unlike console version fun compared newer entries obviously lacking still enjoyable arcadey experience core maps atmospheric creepy enjoyed maps like kino der toten probably also enjoy onesespecially der riese map pap also classic catwalk camp spot custom zombies reason want game pc specifically maps get gameplayaltering mods like zombie realism give entirely different experience custom maps weapons perks newer cod games like bo buyable endings among things quality custom maps varies mapper mapper difficulty map best experience premade group recommended plenty fun playing randoms discussion forums people constantly looking players play custom zombies game lan online hosting online might port forward specific ports game order server appear server browser allbuy sale interested core zombies custom zombies plenty fun zombies might bit much

"This game is a timeless classic. It's one of the perfect FPS' that will ever be made. The movement, wall spamming, hitboxes, and map choices are what make this game the best. I've been playing this game since around 2003. Have played tournaments, been an admin for many clans, and strat caller for matches. This game takes serious skill to get good at. There is a huge learning curve, and that's what seperates this from other games, and noobs and pro's. The people who will get good at this game, are the ones who put the time and effort to learn everything. While the game can be a pick up and play game. Expect your ♥♥♥ to get handed to you, as veterans of the game still heavily play this, and they'll out shoot you 9/10 times. I have been called a cheater countless times in this game, and it all comes from me playing this day and night as a child, and my skills has also transferred into other FPS games. If you get good at CS, you'll more than likely be very good at other FPS games like Over Watch, CoD, 007, etc. Thats why I nominate this game for, The “Test of Time” Award. My friends think I'm dumb for playing a game developed in the 90's, but there's a reason for it. As I said, this game is the perfect FPS. It's a game I will play until I die. I can buy any new game on the market, and I'll be returning to this game shortly after. Take it from someone who has invested a lot of time in this game to get good. It's going to seem scary at first, as you will get rekt. But you will develop friends from within the various communities, and you will get better over time. And this skill set will make you better at other FPS games. CS 1.6 forever!",1,game timeless classic one perfect fps ever made movement wall spamming hitboxes map choices make game best ive playing game since around played tournaments admin many clans strat caller matches game takes serious skill get good huge learning curve thats seperates games noobs pros people get good game ones put time effort learn everything game pick play game expect get handed veterans game still heavily play theyll shoot times called cheater countless times game comes playing day night child skills also transferred fps games get good cs youll likely good fps games like watch cod etc thats nominate game test time award friends think im dumb playing game developed theres reason said game perfect fps game play die buy new game market ill returning game shortly take someone invested lot time game get good going seem scary first get rekt develop friends within various communities get better time skill set make better fps games cs forever

"1999 is when this came out, but when I was born. Gladly though I grew up to find out and discover about this magnificent piece. There was no other game that I played once I purchased this with some B-Day cash on Steam. First time playing, I got mutilated like the noob I was, but when I started playing more often, I became better and everyone else can too.   This isn't like the CODs or Battlefields that I have played here and there today. No it's much more different. Counter-Strike is a Tactical FPS which relies on teamwork and tactics more than fast paced arcade action. You don't unlock weapons, you buy them with cash earned from kiling enemies, completeing objectives, or winning rounds although you still get a little for loosing. Think of the game as Cops &amp; Robbers. Robbers blow things up and the Cops don't them too.  On the extra note, this game has probably one of the best modding communities out there. There too much to do or put in here but I can slam a bit down. -Zombies Survival/Escape -Soccer (Or Football for the Europeans) -Surf -Bhop/KZ (Climbing Zone) -Pokemod -Gungame (Those new may have heard such from Call of Duty's spinoff) -And more, etc.  So now that I've explained the game I guess I can lay down some pro's yet con's to playing Counter-Strike 1.6  PROS -Fun/Unlimited Gameplay possibilities -Booming community that has been alive for 15 years -Plethora of servers to choose from -Competetive and Casual at the same time -Fun to play with a group of friends -More skill based than many other games out there -Cheap price   CONS -Graphics from 1998 may seem slightly offputting -Not an easy game to jump right into, as it takes lots of time to become better -May seem repetitive after a while  I came into CS late. But, I'm glad this was the first one I owned.",1,came born gladly though grew find discover magnificent piece game played purchased bday cash steam first time playing got mutilated like noob started playing often became better everyone else isnt like cods battlefields played today much different counterstrike tactical fps relies teamwork tactics fast paced arcade action dont unlock weapons buy cash earned kiling enemies completeing objectives winning rounds although still get little loosing think game cops amp robbers robbers blow things cops dont extra note game probably one best modding communities much put slam bit zombies survivalescape soccer football europeans surf bhopkz climbing zone pokemod gungame new may heard call dutys spinoff etc ive explained game guess lay pros yet cons playing counterstrike pros fununlimited gameplay possibilities booming community alive years plethora servers choose competetive casual time fun play group friends skill based many games cheap price cons graphics may seem slightly offputting easy game jump right takes lots time become better may seem repetitive came cs late im glad first one owned

"( First impression review ) AWESOME game though can't find a single person to play classic zombies :/ but overall good game love it though the multiplayer is something eh i'm not use to lol i've played through black ops and mw3 multiplayer and waw's multiplayer is way better it feels way down to the game for new players i haven't seen stuff like this in along time my vote 10/10 recommend you buy it :D  ( Edit 1) After playing this game for x ammount of tme and running it through 'most' of it's paces i've decided to edit my review of this game, the game is great all around but in some aspects/features it lacks so i'ma get down to my review at the bottom of this starting with the story mode.  1. Story Mode/single player- I found this game's story quite good though it's very laggy and hard to get into at first I give it a 5/10.  2. Story Mode/Co op - when playing the story mode with friends my game as well as theirs would crash for no appearant reason and i have yet to find the cause i give the co op story mode a 2/10  3. Networking/match making - when joining a co op round with a friend in rare times either person was unable to join the other's match and i have yet to find a cause or a fix to this issue and it is quite rare i give networking/matchmaking a 6/10 for all around.  4. Solo mode zombies - I find this one of the best modes of the game i love it the most cause i can sit and play even with out cheats and go Very far in waves or rounds and have music playing with out worrying about my team mates i give solo mode zombies a 10/10  5. Co op Zombies - I find it hard to find a match for zombies it's sometimes none existant when it is most of the time it's modded maps or people using cheats of some kind but for just private matchs with friends i give the co op zombies a 10/10 for online use i give it a 0/10 because i can't play in a public match because it's mostly private premade teams now.  6. Multiplayer - I like the Multiplayer of world at war but most of the servers are either using cheats or mods and it's extremely hard to find a match enless you custom search one for with out mods or cheats that is in the game mode you desire, Also with most servers the health is very low that being said in most servers the bullets that it takes to kill you are around 3 to 5 rather than almost a full clip depending on the right happen i find this a major disappointment because it's hard to find the guy and shoot him before he shoots me and most times it's a one shot from accross the map so i give multiplayer a 6/10.  7. Graghics/ effects - I have yet to put these through their paces because i'm still running on low settings because my laptop sucks but when i get my new computer and re run this game at max i'll revise my review and add my rating on these but for now i can't.  8. Sound effects - I have to give the sound effects a strong 9/10 they are superb 99 times in each match depending on the weapon.  9. mechanics - the game is old that being said i can't even give it a strong review on these because of it being as old as it is so i'ma give the mechanics a 10/10 for them being as old as they are  10. playerbase - This game has good playerbase alot of nice peopl and such and it's very easy to get a co op or co op zombie match going this being said i give it a 10/10  11. Taking out of all my reviews i give the entire game a 8/10 for it's age and the fact that in some features i can't really put them through their full potential yet i will however do so when i get a better computer.",1,first impression review awesome game though cant find single person play classic zombies overall good game love though multiplayer something eh im use lol ive played black ops mw multiplayer waws multiplayer way better feels way game new players havent seen stuff like along time vote recommend buy edit playing game x ammount tme running paces ive decided edit review game game great around aspectsfeatures lacks ima get review bottom starting story mode story modesingle player found games story quite good though laggy hard get first give story modeco op playing story mode friends game well would crash appearant reason yet find cause give co op story mode networkingmatch making joining co op round friend rare times either person unable join others match yet find cause fix issue quite rare give networkingmatchmaking around solo mode zombies find one best modes game love cause sit play even cheats go far waves rounds music playing worrying team mates give solo mode zombies co op zombies find hard find match zombies sometimes none existant time modded maps people using cheats kind private matchs friends give co op zombies online use give cant play public match mostly private premade teams multiplayer like multiplayer world war servers either using cheats mods extremely hard find match enless custom search one mods cheats game mode desire also servers health low said servers bullets takes kill around rather almost full clip depending right happen find major disappointment hard find guy shoot shoots times one shot accross map give multiplayer graghics effects yet put paces im still running low settings laptop sucks get new computer run game max ill revise review add rating cant sound effects give sound effects strong superb times match depending weapon mechanics game old said cant even give strong review old ima give mechanics old playerbase game good playerbase alot nice peopl easy get co op co op zombie match going said give taking reviews give entire game age fact features cant really put full potential yet however get better computer

"Seinfeld is an American sitcom that originally ran for nine seasons on NBC, from 1989 to 1998. It was created by Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld, the latter starring as a fictionalized version of himself. Set predominantly in an apartment building in Manhattan's Upper West Side in New York City (although taped entirely in Los Angeles), the show features a handful of Jerry's friends and acquaintances, particularly best friend George Costanza (Jason Alexander), former girlfriend Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), and neighbor across the hall Cosmo Kramer (Michael Richards). It is often described as being 'a show about nothing', as many of its episodes are about the minutiae of daily life.

"I'll remind you: I've played CS 1.6 into oblivion on another account. 101 hours is not the full representation of my gameplay in this game.   CS 1.6 is a classic game everybody almost knows what is, at least if you are an FPS player. Of course today it is very outdated and not something you would otherwise play as your main game, but it certainly is something to take a walk through every once in a while - especially as a trip down memory lane or as a fun little LAN game to take your mind off modern games, which can get tiresome after a while (at least in my honest opinion.)   I can definitely recommend this. I played it a lot, and all the while, despite my review of it, CS:CZ had an end consensus that was a better smooth gameplay somewhat, this is one of the best games of all time. At least in terms of the FPS genre. No doubt. But if you were to play it today, you'd have to be patient as the only people still playing this online are either veterans, somewhat experienced people or cheaters (on VAC-insecure servers which there also is quite a lot of.) If you're lucky, you might still find that some of the best servers that kept the community going might still be up. Maybe.

"Back when the CoD-franchise was at its peak quality wise, this was a truly good shooter. Little changed from its predecessor, CoD 4,except it was ww2 again. But on this occasion, that wasn't bad at all. Both games were very solid, had good balance and replayability. You could easily play till the 10th prestige on both games without being bored, unlike nowadays. The campagin was a real challange too, if you played on veteran dificulty. The last CoD-campaign I played on veteran was from CoD: Ghosts and I must say, it was a walk in the park compared to this title.   Sadly, as it is with all old CoD titles except CoD 2, this game is dead. If it would still be played, this would be a nobrainer to buy, but at this state you shouldnt waste your money on a dead game, except you want buy it for nostalgia reasons or the campaign.",1,back codfranchise peak quality wise truly good shooter little changed predecessor cod except ww occasion wasnt bad games solid good balance replayability could easily play till th prestige games without bored unlike nowadays campagin real challange played veteran dificulty last codcampaign played veteran cod ghosts must say walk park compared title sadly old cod titles except cod game dead would still played would nobrainer buy state shouldnt waste money dead game except want buy nostalgia reasons campaign

"For those of you who don't feel like actually playing online with people there is a multiplayer bot mod. In fact i want to say that about 94 hours of my gameplay is against multiplayer bots.  Custom Zombie maps?? Hell yea! Zombies mode is soo much better than that of Bo2 or Advanced Shitfare.  Campaign can't be beat, one of my favorites especially because of the Co-Op option built in (and the occasional friendly fire on my friend ;P)  The game comes with all the DLC for $20... that's probably the best deal out of all the CoD games.  WW2 era? Why the ♥♥♥♥ not? Makes for a great game, imo the best CoD game before it went to crap.  For those who still havent bought it... idk what the hell you're waiting for, but just do it cause for $20 it feels like a $200 value with all the random happiness you can throw in (not in that way sickos)",1,dont feel like actually playing online people multiplayer bot mod fact want say hours gameplay multiplayer bots custom zombie maps hell yea zombies mode soo much better bo advanced shitfare campaign cant beat one favorites especially coop option built occasional friendly fire friend p game comes dlc thats probably best deal cod games ww era makes great game imo best cod game went crap still havent bought idk hell youre waiting cause feels like value random happiness throw way sickos

"World at War was made when Call of Duty still actually cared about their fans, and not about making a quick cash grab.  This game has a marvelous and captivating campaign set in the timeline of WW2 (NOT the future), with memorable characters, as well as a uniquely enjoyable (modded/custom) nazi zombies experience, with an active community of modders and mappers working hard to release professional-looking custom zombies maps for the players. Lastly, this game doesn't have an obnoxious fanbase (no really young kids, mlg quick-scoping, etc.)   It REALLY is an awesome game where the pros outweigh the cons; would definitely recommend.",1,world war made call duty still actually cared fans making quick cash grab game marvelous captivating campaign set timeline ww future memorable characters well uniquely enjoyable moddedcustom nazi zombies experience active community modders mappers working hard release professionallooking custom zombies maps players lastly game doesnt obnoxious fanbase really young kids mlg quickscoping etc really awesome game pros outweigh cons would definitely recommend

"This is an OK game considering what it is - heavily scripted shooter that feels almost like a puzzle game where you have to figure out when and where to move rather than shoot enemies. It took me about 10 hours to beat it, on Hardened difficulty. The scripting was not as tight as the Modern Warfare games, with some bugs here and there. At least the campaign was different from usual WWII shooters, featuring battles in Japan and the Russian invasion of Germany.",1,ok game considering heavily scripted shooter feels almost like puzzle game figure move rather shoot enemies took hours beat hardened difficulty scripting tight modern warfare games bugs least campaign different usual wwii shooters featuring battles japan russian invasion germany

On the downside its clearly no longer updated or in development (although the company that owns it always denies this despite years of no bug fixes or version changes) so if you do happen upon a bug you will have to learn to work around it.   Generally its cheap entry price and simple approach to low poly modelling is refreshing enough its worth picking up when on sale for sure ; otherwise you might want to check out other options like Blender 3D while complex, with overtly complex UI it is constantly being improved upon and free.",1,see ive played game lot unfortunately im sure one would win game hours played remains mystery joking aside silo competent low poly modeler fairly easy use uv unwrap tools downside clearly longer updated development although company owns always denies despite years bug fixes version changes happen upon bug learn work around generally cheap entry price simple approach low poly modelling refreshing enough worth picking sale sure otherwise might want check options like blender complex overtly complex ui constantly improved upon free

Plenty of fun maps to play on, plenty of servers to play on, plenty of customization options. This is one game that you can really taylor to suit your style. Plenty of user created skins for your weapons that can really make this game look amazing. And I still prefer counter strike over counter strike source. I don't know, call it nostalgia or whatever but there really is something about just good ol' counter strike 1.6 that is just simply magical. It truley is a classic in every sense of the word. And STILL is just as enjoyable (if not more enjoyable) then any online shooter on the market today. So glad I got to grow up with this game.

"The Call of Duty franchise was great until this game came out, where do i begin...  Pros:  Historical accuracy and information is much more than the previous games.  You get to play as an American captive in the Pacific Theatre, which was never done in the previous two games  You can throw a activated grenade back at the enemy if you are quick enough.  On that note, you get far less ammo than the previous two games, making the game more realistic  You can reload the M1 Grand without having to deplete the entire clip.  Cons:  The voice acting is disgusting. It sounds like it was tacked on as an afterthought rather than integrated into the actual game. It sounds like Treyarch hired the actors from b-reel movies.  The cinematics don't show a lot of game play, They are also too 'active' and they do not give us enough time to let us understand what we are supposed to learn from the Pacific Theatre, for example.  The FOV is horrendous, and while there is mod support, a game this advanced should have come standard with an FOV Slider.  The sound quality in general is not of the same fidelity as it was in the previous two games. Granted the engine is more 'advanced,' I liked the clip ejection 'ping' from the M1 Grand from the previous two games.  Conclusion:  I am thankful I got this was a part of the CoD War Chest bundle over Christmas 2015 rather than full price. This game is not worth your money since it takes so many steps back and tries to become an interactive movie instead. Very disappointed by the quality of this game overall. At least it looks pretty.",-1,call duty franchise great game came begin pros historical accuracy information much previous games get play american captive pacific theatre never done previous two games throw activated grenade back enemy quick enough note get far less ammo previous two games making game realistic reload grand without deplete entire clip cons voice acting disgusting sounds like tacked afterthought rather integrated actual game sounds like treyarch hired actors breel movies cinematics dont show lot game play also active give us enough time let us understand supposed learn pacific theatre example fov horrendous mod support game advanced come standard fov slider sound quality general fidelity previous two games granted engine advanced liked clip ejection ping grand previous two games conclusion thankful got part cod war chest bundle christmas rather full price game worth money since takes many steps back tries become interactive movie instead disappointed quality game overall least looks pretty

"Counter-Strike, oh Counter-Strike... so, so many hours of playing 1.6 back in high school, getting on the local campus server and playing de_dust, cs_office, de_aztec adn so many more, my first 'modern' FPS. While it has had enhancements of Source and GO, the core CS remains a tight, amazing game with plenty of players. Well-balanced weapons, well-designed maps, no real skill cap, if you need a great multiplayer FPS experience that can run on almost any piece of hardware (I ran this on my Pentium 4 with integrated graphics and 512 MB RAM back in 2004!), then this is for you.

"Advantages: a good idea, an opportunity to play on a network Disadvantages: poor performance, graphics, textures, defects. Collection of my reviews on video games continues. Today we will speak about the most famous first-person shooter 'Counter-Strike'.  Igrushechki this appeared quite a long time, already in the year 2000 and won the gamers. Then all these 'shooters' were a novelty, and of course all like this game. I knew about it a long time, I heard enthusiastic talks about it, heard the word 'bots', 'contra', 'headshot of', 'ks'. And what is it, I managed to learn five or six years ago. Games then I was not 'tempted', but even then I have appreciated this game for three and a minus. Why? I'll explain later. Now the whole of the game. Created her notorious guys with the short name 'Valve'. About 'Valve's' I will say this: all of their games on the subject stopped 'fantasy' and 'half-real.' And this game belongs to the second category.  So, the creators of the idea is quite tempting. Confrontation of the law against terrorists. They gave the game the proud name of 'Counter-Strike', ie 'counter-attack', but that's just shock, as such, no intrigue in this game. And that is? There are running with a gun, a gun, a knife. Oh yes, there is another grenade (use 0). And you can take the shield (not a bad thing). We can play for the 'special forces' (which I did) and terror (very few people want). Most probably the main thing here is that we can play a 'bot' that is, our friends runs the computer, the computer runs our enemies, but we can play and through the network, where all have real people. Play over the Internet more interesting, but still 'stupid'.  I do not want to talk about any reality or fiction, but all I will say. I have not seen, not in movies, not in life, to special forces, and the terrorists jumped as the 'hare', climbed the stairs, as if running on the ground. And finally, it is that even the slightest preparation is absent, the men can not hit no shield, no weapons, no arms / legs. The hostages, but here too there are, behave calmly, stand, no one is afraid of fear or cry.  So, I criticized a little, and now tell you about the features. Game modes are different, rescuing hostages, rescue VIP-a, defusing a bomb, knife, grenade. A quest we give money, we buy ourselves, that it is necessary, for example, body armor (a rare case when it is not worn in advance on fighter (in reality)). On the job, we allocated time, which is usually enough. Each of the men says that he wants and commands that it is possible to give no one is listening. By the way, there you can sprinkle a logo that can be selected in advance.

"Call of Duty: World at War is a 2008, historical first-person shooter that takes place in the Pacific Front between the United States and Japan, including the Eastern Front between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Developed by Treyarch and published by Activision, the game takes a different approach than previous Call of Duty titles as the presentation takes a gritty look into the world conflict. The dark overtone, gore, and the true nature of warfare is presented. Does Call of Duty: World at War has your attention?  As mentioned earlier, World at War takes a gritty look into World War II than its predecessors. The atmosphere is grim and depressing as you fight your way to Berlin as Private Dimitri Petrenko or as Private Miller hearing the scream of Japanese soldiers charging your positions or the death sirens of burning men. The presentation is outstanding and the game takes inspiration from mature war documentaries (actual combat footage from the Pacific and Eastern Front) or recent war films from the 1990s to the present time. The game does not restrict the nature of warfare. The graphics is pretty solid, even for the game that came out in 2008. Besides the graphics and presentation, the sound effects are actually impressive, ranging from the M1 Garand “ping” sound, the M1919 Browning machine gun, the German FG42, the Japanese Type 99 LMG, and many other weaponries. Kudos to Treyarch for the sound effects. The voice acting from Kiefer Sutherland and Gary Oldman are solid and memorable. Lastly, the campaign was good, even great with intense moments from the Soviet and American campaigns.   While World at War has many, outstanding attributes, there are some negative factors that must be taken into consideration. First, the Veteran (hardest) difficulty is a joke. Grenade spamming from enemy AI, unlimited enemy spawn, and lack of a legitimate challenge is a disaster for the Veteran difficulty level. The only way possible to end unlimited enemy spawning is to move forward (and do not stop). The infamous, Heart of the Reich level was a lot of stress when you have to destroy the 4 Flak88 guns while being grenade spammed, dodging enemy AI fire, and healing yourself. Unfortunately, Treyarch was unable to balance out the Veteran difficulty into an actual difficulty challenge without feeling cheated or cop-out. Some of the weapon modeling in the game feels odd and looks weird, particularly the Japanese Arisaka bolt-action rifles, the Thompson, and the pistols from all factions. While this factor might consider as a “neutral” factor, I also noticed a notable amount of over-the-top explosions, cinematic moments in the game when shooting at Japanese boats and ships or buildings. Admittedly, I find the explosions a bit excessive, leaning more into Michael Bay territory but this is based upon personal taste. Lastly, the sale price is a bitter disappointment from Activision. I already mentioned this on my (original) Call of Duty review, but this has to be addressed again.   Call of Duty: World at War was released the year after Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. The game fell under MW’s shadow and many gamers were favoring more on present time military setting than World War II or historical shooters. World at War was considered as one of the last World War II titles in the 7th generation of video game consoles (Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Nintendo Wii generation) and this was before the long drought on no historical first-person shooters until the recent revival and interest of World War II (and historical) games in 2014/2015. I didn’t play much of the Nazi zombies cooperative multiplayer, but the impressions were pretty good in the PC version, especially with the mods.

The story isn't all way's the same, the is something always different depending on the choice you take. 10. You can play the campaign with friends online. 11. It explores battles that haven't been explored too much. 12. The Tank mission is fun. 13. The enlightening is lovely. 14. The Zombie maps are time freaky and zombie like. 15.

The warfootage in the cutscenes are so outstanding. 19. The environments look nearly real. 20. The characters voices are awsome. 21. The game has wartime sadness and ambition in it. 22. You can make your own custom zombie maps. 23. Its MY Favourite GAME! Cons: 1. It needs more missions in Stalingrad. 2. More missions in places like Russia, Poland, Saipan, Wake island, Midway, Philippines and more. 3. It had more vehicle missions. 4. On the tank mission the tank driver is the guy who is fighting in Stalingrad in the infantry, he is a infantryman, not a Tank guy. 5. On the plane mission I wish there was more infomation about your character. 6. I wish you could be Axis too. 7. That the bots are really dumb. 8. I wish it was longer. 9. That you can drop the two bombs on Japan. 10. I wish you can choose more country to been in then Russia and U.S.A. 11. That you can be real heroes of the War. 12. That you can do the Western Front. 13. That you can upgrade weapons on singleplayer. 14. That there were more weapons. 15. There should be a mission were you kill Hitler in his bunker. 16. All the enemy soldiers look all basely the same, in the country faces that is. 17. There are some historical errors. 18. The campgain is too short. 19. There are no achievements and badges. 20.

"  Call of Duty: World at War   is a first person shooter created by Treyarch for PC and consoles. Originally named '  Call of Duty 5  ', the game continues, and subsequently finishes, the World War II setting started from the first game, '  Call of Duty  '. It is the first game within the '  Call of Duty: Black Ops  ' series, although not branded/labeled as a 'Black Ops' game itself. It is considered the goriest, most emotionally hard hitting, and realistic   Call of Duty   video game to date.    Call of Duty: World at War   is a fictional video game depicting the fictional lives of two Privates during the denouement of World War II. The game starts with an American Army soldier named Private C. Miller and his journey throughout the beaches and lands of Japan, marching and fighting his way through Makin, Okanawa, and Peleliu Island with Sergeant Thomas Sullivan (who is murdered by a Japanese soldier early in the campaign), who is later replaced by Sergeant Roebuck. After the American-sided introduction, the game then switches to Soviet Union Red Army soldier Private Dimitri Petrenko, and his journey with Sergeant Reznov, Private Chernov, and the rest of the Red Army as they charge their way throughout Stalingrad in Russia, to the fields of Seelow in Germany, and subsequently to Berlin as they cut down all in their path, fighting and brutally slaughtering their way into the Reichstag, to slice down the facist Reich's flag, and to wave ultimate victory over Germany for Mother Russia.  Campaign ================================ The game starts with the American campaign, with Pvt. Miller, along with Sgt. Roebuck and Sullivan, charging through Makin with their battalions, falling into ambushes, and blowing up an ammo depot. The game, after 3 American based missions, switches to the Russian side of the campaign. The Russian campaign starts with the player, Pvt. Petrenko, lying in the slaughter of his comrades after a massacre at a fountain at the Red Square in Stalingrad. The player then continues with Sgt. Reznov to assassinate a German General named Amsel, to avenge the fallen soldiers who had died at Stalingrad. Afterwards, they escape Stalingrad and begin their own adventure to take back Russia, and later Berlin.  The game continues with multiple battles and conflicts, which when paired with Sean Murray's amazing music, make the whole experience very emotionally hard hitting, and unforgettable. To the Russian Battle Theme, and the 'Black Cats' fighting theme, the game deliveres an amazing experience that reminisces of the golden days of   Call of Duty   video games.  Zombies ================================   Call of Duty: World at War   intruduces a new 'Nazi Zombies' mode into the franchise. The mode centers around an operative (or a group of operatives) as they are stranded at a certain base, in need of rescue, from a pending Nazi Zombie invasion. The group/player must work together/alone to fight their way through the carnage and to escape the compound they are in, being supplied with multiple weapons, and powerups through the way.  This mode is definitely worth a try, and a good move on Treyarch.  Multiplayer ================================ With the singleplayer campaign, the game also presents a co-op mode, which allows you to play the campaign with friends. It enables the new 'DeathCards' cheats, which reveal special cheats as you collect them throughout the campaign. They're mostly jokes, such as the cheat that replaces all your weapons with stones. I ♥♥♥♥ you not.  While the true multiplayer is broken, it can be fixed by following the  PC Gaming wiki article here  [pcgamingwiki.com] .  Upon fixing the multiplayer, most players will notice that almost all the servers are sadly modded. Most servers have leveling cheats enabled, where-in your first 5 minutes of gameplay the player will most likely already be leveled to level 28. I have suffered this, and many others have/will too.  Ignoring that, the multiplayer is mostly fun. There's multiple modes that will deliver a fun arcade experience for the player. Nothing much to say here.  Issues/Bugs/Glitches ================================ Albeit all the great things about the game, it does present multiple issues. For starters, the game has a failsafe where if the player does not advance at all, it will start spamming grenades at the player until they move forward. On most difficulties, this is usually 1 to 3 grenades. While this doesn't sound too bad, it becomes a terrible experience on Veteran difficulties, as the player will most likely have 6-7, even 8 grenades thrown at them at once.  The game also suffers from terrible AI issues. An example is in 'Vendetta', the first Russian campaign mission. During the part where you must protect your comrades as they storm a communications center, sometimes of the AI will become confused, and refuse to navigate. This results in a crash, which you must ALT+TAB out to see (as the game does not close automatically). Sadly, this has happened to me at least 4 times throughout the campaign, with both American and Russian campaigns. The AI can also be oblivious to enemies, where they (sometimes) will stand their and absorb bullets until they die, doing nothing. This is most prominant on Veteran mode, and leads to an annoying experience, since your comrades will not help you AT ALL during these fire-fights. Happily, Sgt. Roebuck nor Reznov will never have these errors; as Reznov stays in the back (never moving unless it's a scripted event), and Roebuck stays behind cover all of the time throwing grenades and using his pistol. The enemies also feel like they all have aimbot on higher difficulties, and aren't actually aiming for the armies as a whole; just you and you alone.  Final Remarks ================================ I definitely recommend this game to EVERYONE who has a love for first person shooters, war video games, or Call of Duty games, as this game will find a way to take camp in anyones heart and mind.  This game is simply amazing, despite the issues it has, and definitely deserves a chance to be played by everyone.  ================================    FINAL RATING :  8/10",1,call duty world war first person shooter created treyarch pc consoles originally named call duty game continues subsequently finishes world war ii setting started first game call duty first game within call duty black ops series although brandedlabeled black ops game considered goriest emotionally hard hitting realistic call duty video game date call duty world war fictional video game depicting fictional lives two privates denouement world war ii game starts american army soldier named private c miller journey throughout beaches lands japan marching fighting way makin okanawa peleliu island sergeant thomas sullivan murdered japanese soldier early campaign later replaced sergeant roebuck americansided introduction game switches soviet union red army soldier private dimitri petrenko journey sergeant reznov private chernov rest red army charge way throughout stalingrad russia fields seelow germany subsequently berlin cut path fighting brutally slaughtering way reichstag slice facist reichs flag wave ultimate victory germany mother russia campaign game starts american campaign pvt miller along sgt roebuck sullivan charging makin battalions falling ambushes blowing ammo depot game american based missions switches russian side campaign russian campaign starts player pvt petrenko lying slaughter comrades massacre fountain red square stalingrad player continues sgt reznov assassinate german general named amsel avenge fallen soldiers died stalingrad afterwards escape stalingrad begin adventure take back russia later berlin game continues multiple battles conflicts paired sean murrays amazing music make whole experience emotionally hard hitting unforgettable russian battle theme black cats fighting theme game deliveres amazing experience reminisces golden days call duty video games zombies call duty world war intruduces new nazi zombies mode franchise mode centers around operative group operatives stranded certain base need rescue pending nazi zombie invasion groupplayer must work togetheralone fight way carnage escape compound supplied multiple weapons powerups way mode definitely worth try good move treyarch multiplayer singleplayer campaign game also presents coop mode allows play campaign friends enables new deathcards cheats reveal special cheats collect throughout campaign theyre mostly jokes cheat replaces weapons stones true multiplayer broken fixed following pc gaming wiki article pcgamingwikicom upon fixing multiplayer players notice almost servers sadly modded servers leveling cheats enabled wherein first minutes gameplay player likely already leveled level suffered many others havewill ignoring multiplayer mostly fun theres multiple modes deliver fun arcade experience player nothing much say issuesbugsglitches albeit great things game present multiple issues starters game failsafe player advance start spamming grenades player move forward difficulties usually grenades doesnt sound bad becomes terrible experience veteran difficulties player likely even grenades thrown game also suffers terrible ai issues example vendetta first russian campaign mission part must protect comrades storm communications center sometimes ai become confused refuse navigate results crash must alttab see game close automatically sadly happened least times throughout campaign american russian campaigns ai also oblivious enemies sometimes stand absorb bullets die nothing prominant veteran mode leads annoying experience since comrades help firefights happily sgt roebuck reznov never errors reznov stays back never moving unless scripted event roebuck stays behind cover time throwing grenades using pistol enemies also feel like aimbot higher difficulties arent actually aiming armies whole alone final remarks definitely recommend game everyone love first person shooters war video games call duty games game find way take camp anyones heart mind game simply amazing despite issues definitely deserves chance played everyone final rating

"- Horrible console FOV that feels terrible playing on a monitor three feet away rather than a big TV ten feet away. For the peanut gallery: FOV has nothing to do with the quality of your screen, it's about how much you can see, and has a big effect on whether you get motion sickness playing a game. Most modern 1st person games have adjustable FOV sliders in the options. This doesn't, and the FOV is way too narrow.  - Stupid 'portraits' of a developer in Nazi uniiform hanging up in buildings. This isn't an Easter Egg. It might be if there was *one* in a difficult-to-find room: these are all over bombed-out Berlin, where in the Third Reich pretty much every building would have had a picture of Adolf Hitler. It doesn't feel like a cheeky hidden secret, it feels like smirking, masturbatory game developer BS. It also doesn't help that the person in question is a pudgy neckbeard who doesn't in the slightest resemble the average Nazi officer ubermensch type. Maybe Reinhard Heydrich had a shelf full of panty-flashing anime statuettes above his desk, but he sure didn't look that way: this guy does, and it's a huge immersion breaker.  - Keeps calling Soviets 'Russians'. No, this isn't 'racism', it's historical inaccuracy. The Red Army was composed of troops from all over the USSR, not just Russia. It's like calling anyone from the USA a Texan.  Feels like it was developed by people who've seen lots of movies and never read a book (I guess that's the target audience too - a death spiral of ignorance). I'd like to say 'but hey, it's Call of Duty, whaddya expect', but I can't, because the first CoD game was superb. However, this one comes from the same clowns who gave us the Black Ops series, so it's a lot of Michael Bay-style orange fireball theatre, cliches and general d1ck-wagging.  The briefings are nicely done, though.",-1,horrible console fov feels terrible playing monitor three feet away rather big tv ten feet away peanut gallery fov nothing quality screen much see big effect whether get motion sickness playing game modern st person games adjustable fov sliders options doesnt fov way narrow stupid portraits developer nazi uniiform hanging buildings isnt easter egg might one difficulttofind room bombedout berlin third reich pretty much every building would picture adolf hitler doesnt feel like cheeky hidden secret feels like smirking masturbatory game developer bs also doesnt help person question pudgy neckbeard doesnt slightest resemble average nazi officer ubermensch type maybe reinhard heydrich shelf full pantyflashing anime statuettes desk sure didnt look way guy huge immersion breaker keeps calling soviets russians isnt racism historical inaccuracy red army composed troops ussr russia like calling anyone usa texan feels like developed people whove seen lots movies never read book guess thats target audience death spiral ignorance id like say hey call duty whaddya expect cant first cod game superb however one comes clowns gave us black ops series lot michael baystyle orange fireball theatre cliches general dckwagging briefings nicely done though

"The game is meh, at best. It may be a really good game in 2008; but due to the excessive milking to the series, the online community has shrinked to a handful of full lobbies. You often need to disable punkbuster in order to play online. The only lobbies that you could play (really) is a crouch-prone only hardcore lobby, a boosting lobby (where you stand and let others shoot you), and the rare 'vanilla' servers.  If you want to play this game for its campaign, it is rather fun, but there is little replay value. Zombies, it is really fun, and it is better compared to the consoles, because you could enable dev's command and enable godmode, etc.  The only thing I liked about this game is that they gave out free maps, when on the consoles there are 3 DLC's for about $10(?) each. I wish that the game's community/playbase was more larger and alive. (This game was the last good and well-done ported COD game.)

I was playing this game on a deathrun server , barely 7 days from the day I had brought this game. My router went off for a second and when it was back on I saw that I had been VAC banned. Reason : Cheating inflaction. How the hell do you use cheat on a deathrun server ?! And one more thing : The steam guys say that VAC BAN is delayed and takes time , then how the hell did it BAN me in just 31 hours of gameplay ?

"Single player wise, I thought COD 4 (Modern Warfare) was good and refreshing. But this... this is back to enemies (and comrades) showing up in endless streams and it's badly masked. There are attempts to tell some kind of story and make the player bond to characters, but they fail. Might be related to the situation always being 'OMG WE HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD AND KILL THE BAD GUYS'. While action is nice, a change in pace could have helped the 'story'.  The entire thing feels soulless and predictable from start to end. This has been done before.  Can't speak for multiplayer.",-1,single player wise thought cod modern warfare good refreshing back enemies comrades showing endless streams badly masked attempts tell kind story make player bond characters fail might related situation always omg move forward kill bad guys action nice change pace could helped story entire thing feels soulless predictable start end done cant speak multiplayer

One word: Awesome  But for real this game was my first COD and will always have a place in my heart. It has everything. A cool and interesting story line when you switch between 2 different soldiers. One fighting Japan and the other taking back Russia. But the best part comes when you play zombies. When I first played this game on my Xbox all I did was play zombies. It was what made me get into zombies today. A couple years latter I get a good computer and buy this game. My friend tells me to download this map for zombies called Cheese Cube. So I did and I had a blast.

"Best cod to date  I don't really play (or like) any of the call of duty multiplayer, I've always been more interested in the campaign and ZOMBIES. The campaign is by far better than any other COD yet (up there with MW2), allowing you to play as two of the allied forces during WWII.   WARNING: THIS GAME IS ♥♥♥♥ING HARD Even on normal difficulty, I'll die maybe 12 times in a mission. Not sure if it was because I was rushing to unlock zombies, or if it is just genuinely challenging. Playing as Dimitri is way more enjoyable than playing as Miller. Playing as Miller just felt like midlessly being attacked by and attacking Japanese and his missions never had any depth.  Playing as Dimitri is a GORGEOUS simulation of humiliation and vengeance, leading up to an insane climactic ending, mowing down nazis like a ♥♥♥♥ing machine.   Pros: -Great campaign -Beautiful scenery -Nazi zombies -Great guns -Nazi zombies -Challenging -Best single player gameplay in any cod -Nazi zombies -Nazi zombies -♥♥♥♥ing nazi zombies -Did I mention nazi zombies?

"Counter-Strike makes you work to enjoy the content, and you'll have to put many hours of play into it before enjoying the feeling of conquering it.  Weapons are a huge part of the series too, with CS:GO not an exception. Each round provides a cash sum based on your previous performance, and with this you can purchase armour, projectiles and weapons. Firearms range from standard assault rifles to shotguns and sniper rifles, and you'll want to experiment with each one to see which works best.  What makes Counter-Strike such a popular series - and what will no doubt make CS:GO the next big PC shooter - is the thrill of the ego chase. As you die, often continuously, the frustration is outweighed by an aspiration to do better. In a game where success is pinned on attention to detail, death often triggers an internal failure analysis that the player will mull over while waiting for a new session to load. It becomes a spiral of egging yourself on to do better - and if you become a good player, the game becomes a stage for you to parade your skills.  Global Offensive builds on the CS series by going through a significant checklist presented by its community and marking off as many points as possible. Gun game as its own separate mode? Check. Competitive capabilities built in? Check. Map balancing here and there? Check, check, check.  As a result, there are numerous upgrades that will adjust gameplay while also making accessibility far better. The wide range of grenades, for example, will likely make play more tactical - laying down incendiary grenades will thwart rushes, while decoys, which fake gunfire and fool radar points, are brilliant tools for messing with the minds of established players.  The actual core shooting will be a huge talking point for many months to come. It has been tinkered slightly and gives weapons a noticeably floaty feel, which doesn't sit well to begin with. We eventually found ourselves enamoured by it, and the impact of hits add a real tactile distinction to play.  It's what doesn't work, however, that is most notable. Regular mode has no new maps added to it, while all the new guns seem somewhat cosmetic. Global Offensive has also removed some of its middling weapons such as the MP5, essentially pushing even more players to stick with the AK and the M4. Sometimes it gives the impression that there is in fact less valuable content than in previous CS releases.  If one assumed this was Counter-Strike Source with a visual mod installed, there would often be little to shake that impression.  There's also now a split between casual and competitive servers - however, many players aren't yet aware of the differences, mainly because the distinction isn't made obvious enough. It becomes even more confusing if you join a community server with all hosts of mods installed on it, which have perhaps taken casual mode, turned friendly fire on and essentially made it as close to Source as possible.  At times, arranging games in Competitive Mode feels like a chore. Joining a five-on-five war is simple enough, but attempt to lobby up with a group of friends and join a game, and you'll often hit a snag. Myself and a few others tried to find a competitive game with no luck, simply being told that no servers were currently available.  When you finally do join, it works fine, but the wait and work required to find a game seems like a drawback. We eventually gave up and resorted to using IRC to find matches, as we would with Source.  Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is not the key evolution point that we were hoping for, and the response from the community often reflects this view. On many occasions, other players used phrases such as 'same old' to us.  This is elementally Counter-Strike Source with some fine-tuning under the bonnet, and Valve appears to have acknowledged this with the reasonable RRP attached to it.  And yet the core DNA of the game has not lost its appeal. This is still a glorious experience that sets a benchmark for all multiplayer shooters. Valve's objective with Global Offensive was to draw together the active communities of both the Source and trusty 1.6 edition. It clearly has a good chance.",1,counterstrike makes work enjoy content youll put many hours play enjoying feeling conquering weapons huge part series csgo exception round provides cash sum based previous performance purchase armour projectiles weapons firearms range standard assault rifles shotguns sniper rifles youll want experiment one see works best makes counterstrike popular series doubt make csgo next big pc shooter thrill ego chase die often continuously frustration outweighed aspiration better game success pinned attention detail death often triggers internal failure analysis player mull waiting new session load becomes spiral egging better become good player game becomes stage parade skills global offensive builds cs series going significant checklist presented community marking many points possible gun game separate mode check competitive capabilities built check map balancing check check check result numerous upgrades adjust gameplay also making accessibility far better wide range grenades example likely make play tactical laying incendiary grenades thwart rushes decoys fake gunfire fool radar points brilliant tools messing minds established players actual core shooting huge talking point many months come tinkered slightly gives weapons noticeably floaty feel doesnt sit well begin eventually found enamoured impact hits add real tactile distinction play doesnt work however notable regular mode new maps added new guns seem somewhat cosmetic global offensive also removed middling weapons mp essentially pushing even players stick ak sometimes gives impression fact less valuable content previous cs releases one assumed counterstrike source visual mod installed would often little shake impression theres also split casual competitive servers however many players arent yet aware differences mainly distinction isnt made obvious enough becomes even confusing join community server hosts mods installed perhaps taken casual mode turned friendly fire essentially made close source possible times arranging games competitive mode feels like chore joining fiveonfive war simple enough attempt lobby group friends join game youll often hit snag others tried find competitive game luck simply told servers currently available finally join works fine wait work required find game seems like drawback eventually gave resorted using irc find matches would source counterstrike global offensive key evolution point hoping response community often reflects view many occasions players used phrases old us elementally counterstrike source finetuning bonnet valve appears acknowledged reasonable rrp attached yet core dna game lost appeal still glorious experience sets benchmark multiplayer shooters valves objective global offensive draw together active communities source trusty edition clearly good chance

"Lemme teach you about the Counter-Strike family history: Counter-Strike 1.6 was the eldest son. As he grew up, people came to love him as a good-hearted, generous man that was perfect in every way. As he grew older and older, the public came to appreciate the work he put in for everybody else and he soon became a household name. Him and his followers became very eccentric and stuck to the old ways. Counter-Strike: Source was the middle child. Everybody expected him to follow in his brother's footsteps but somewhere he went wrong. CS:S was a damn sight nicer than 1.6 and he was still loved by many but never achieved as much as his elder brother did, always in his shadow. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was the youngest child. CS:GO was the child that Gooseman and Cliffe became ashamed of. They tried to hide the fact that CS:GO was completely ♥♥♥♥ing autistic but eventually it seeped out and now masses have come to love him, even though 1.6 is the best.",1,lemme teach counterstrike family history counterstrike eldest son grew people came love goodhearted generous man perfect every way grew older older public came appreciate work put everybody else soon became household name followers became eccentric stuck old ways counterstrike source middle child everybody expected follow brothers footsteps somewhere went wrong css damn sight nicer still loved many never achieved much elder brother always shadow counterstrike global offensive youngest child csgo child gooseman cliffe became ashamed tried hide fact csgo completely ing autistic eventually seeped masses come love even though best

"Once upon a time, there was a Call of Duty game that, much like the others, recieved hate for being part of the CoD francise. However, it had many great things that people consider groundbreaking in newer CoDs such as gore and interactive map elements (in the form of tanks). Once upon a time, that game wasn't infested by hackers in multplayer. That game was Call of Duty World at War. A fantastic WW2 game that was on par with Brothers in Arms for showing how dark WW2 (or any war for that matter) was/can be. We had access to many weapons of devestation, from M1A1 Bazookas, to M2-2 Flamethrowers, and other feared weapons such as the MG42, or as many soldiers dubbed it, 'Hitler's Buzzsaw.' Explosives and large calibre ammunition showed their true power when they ripped apart characters limb by limb, the flamethrower engulfed and charred the bodies of soldiers in true awe. But the experience doesn't just end with a heroic end to a dark and gritty campaign and 80+levels of multiplayer, oh no, for an extra, small map had made it into the game; Nacht der Untoten, Night of the Living Dead. In a move that caught everyone, even many of the employees at Treyarch, offguard, an extra mode was added into Call of Duty that would be immortalized as a icon of the series. Nazi Zombies. Many players, myself included, spent countless hours having fun with this little surprise. And it didn't end there; more maps were added, and all Treyarch games since have had it included, as if the modding community wasn't putting out enough maps as it was. But its time was cut short when Modern Warfare 2 came out the next year and as the fanbase moved on, the hackers moved in, polluting the public multiplayer lobbies like a cancer, making people less inclined to play the game. And so ends the story of Call of Duty World at War... or does it? No, the game won't die for a long time because of its dedicated custom map making community, creating more and more great Zombies experiences each day.",1,upon time call duty game much like others recieved hate part cod francise however many great things people consider groundbreaking newer cods gore interactive map elements form tanks upon time game wasnt infested hackers multplayer game call duty world war fantastic ww game par brothers arms showing dark ww war matter wascan access many weapons devestation bazookas flamethrowers feared weapons mg many soldiers dubbed hitlers buzzsaw explosives large calibre ammunition showed true power ripped apart characters limb limb flamethrower engulfed charred bodies soldiers true awe experience doesnt end heroic end dark gritty campaign levels multiplayer oh extra small map made game nacht der untoten night living dead move caught everyone even many employees treyarch offguard extra mode added call duty would immortalized icon series nazi zombies many players included spent countless hours fun little surprise didnt end maps added treyarch games since included modding community wasnt putting enough maps time cut short modern warfare came next year fanbase moved hackers moved polluting public multiplayer lobbies like cancer making people less inclined play game ends story call duty world war game wont die long time dedicated custom map making community creating great zombies experiences day

All of the new Call of Duty games these days are trying too hard to make it accessible for everyone. What they don't understand is that the games that made the franchise extremely popular were the games that were'nt afraid to step over the line. The campaign of this game really shows World War II at its core; a grey wasteland that many men would simply crumble in the presence of. It really shows how much you can accomplish if you're willing to take risks. I just wish the new games would do the same. Blood and gore is taken out of games because it's not 'child friendly'. War is not child friendly. What are all Call of Duty games? War. Sorry for going mid-rant. The point is this game is a 10/10 compared to other Call of Duty titles.,1,new call duty games days trying hard make accessible everyone dont understand games made franchise extremely popular games werent afraid step line campaign game really shows world war ii core grey wasteland many men would simply crumble presence really shows much accomplish youre willing take risks wish new games would blood gore taken games child friendly war child friendly call duty games war sorry going midrant point game compared call duty titles

"Campaign: This is by far my favorite campaign in Call of Duty. The grim, brutal and graphic nature of the campaign really makes the game feel like World War 2, the deadliest war of all time. You play as the Soviets against Nazi Germany in one campaign. You witness the beginning of the war with a grim scene of death and an enticing sniper battle. You then find yourself breaking into the heart of Germany and the destruction of the Fatherland. You also get to prove yourself as either an emotionless monster or a forgiving soul. You also play as the American's against the Japanese. You will witness the Japanese banzai tactics and guerilla warfare. You will go from hot, dry out in the open fighting to narrow caves and muddy, rainy hills. You will witness the downfall of the Japanese Empire from start to finish.  Both campaigns are very enticing and the missions, although action packed, are memorable and the environment/scenes make it seem realistic.  Multiplayer: The multiplayer is fun, although sadly their is no matchmaking for PC like their is on console. You have to search through the list of servers. A lot are crouch servers/tactical servers which can be a +1 or a -1. I'm personally fine with it. Game also comes with all DLC's so you get all the maps.  Zombies: Yes, zombies. The masterpiece of World at War. It all started here. You get all the zombie maps, plus there is hundreds of custom zombies maps that make the zombies experience endless. This is a big highlight of the PC version. You can easily play with your friends. You can do cheats as well. I'd say the zombies is the best reason to get the PC version over the console versions.  Graphics: Pretty nice for their time. I wouldn't criticize it since the rest of the game makes up for it.   Overall 9.5/10 I take 0.5 off for the lack of matchmaking. Otherwise I love WAW and have played it on my friends accounts and have spent atleast 100 hrs on the PS3 version.",1,campaign far favorite campaign call duty grim brutal graphic nature campaign really makes game feel like world war deadliest war time play soviets nazi germany one campaign witness beginning war grim scene death enticing sniper battle find breaking heart germany destruction fatherland also get prove either emotionless monster forgiving soul also play americans japanese witness japanese banzai tactics guerilla warfare go hot dry open fighting narrow caves muddy rainy hills witness downfall japanese empire start finish campaigns enticing missions although action packed memorable environmentscenes make seem realistic multiplayer multiplayer fun although sadly matchmaking pc like console search list servers lot crouch serverstactical servers im personally fine game also comes dlcs get maps zombies yes zombies masterpiece world war started get zombie maps plus hundreds custom zombies maps make zombies experience endless big highlight pc version easily play friends cheats well id say zombies best reason get pc version console versions graphics pretty nice time wouldnt criticize since rest game makes overall take lack matchmaking otherwise love waw played friends accounts spent atleast hrs ps version

"This was THE Call of Duty game. I don't care about the others. This one was the best.   Beware if you buy this: This game is old, therefore, modern PC hardware doesn't run it as well. I've had a lot of trouble with this game, and as a matter of fact, it's starting to crash on me again. The vertical sync is a nightmare in this game, if you turn it off, the game runs like ♥♥♥♥, if you turn it on, the game stutters like ♥♥♥♥. If you own a 120/144hz monitor you'll fair better, but you'll have to mess with the max framerate in the console to get it working properly. As I mentioned before the game does crash from time to time. If you tab out, there is a good likelyhood the game will crash upon tabbing back in, and the only way to exit the crashed game is to sign out of your PC and sign back in.  TL;DR  -DO NOT buy this game if you hate optimization issues.  -DO NOT buy this game for the multiplayer, there is none anymore, or at least nobody playing it.  -DO buy this game for the zombies. This game has, hands down, the best zombies mode in all of COD. -DO buy this game if you want some quick WWII action.",1,call duty game dont care others one best beware buy game old therefore modern pc hardware doesnt run well ive lot trouble game matter fact starting crash vertical sync nightmare game turn game runs like turn game stutters like hz monitor youll fair better youll mess max framerate console get working properly mentioned game crash time time tab good likelyhood game crash upon tabbing back way exit crashed game sign pc sign back tldr buy game hate optimization issues buy game multiplayer none anymore least nobody playing buy game zombies game hands best zombies mode cod buy game want quick wwii action

"Bought this during the Activision publisher sale, and I must say, it was quite the deal.  One could say, 'It's $20, it would be cheaper just to get a used 360/PS3 copy from GameStop,' or something to that extent.  And you could.  But for $20 (or $10 in my case, since it was on sale), you have a brand new copy that you can't scratch or lose, full mod support, free multiplayer, and all of the Zombies maps for World at War. That's pretty hard to beat.   As far as gameplay goes, this is quite possibly the best COD game made, and its even better for PC. Nothing beats the experience of being able to play 1080p on max graphic settings, with a nice pair of headphones.  Campaign is great, Zombies of course is awesome, and there is multiplayer, which I have yet to delve into because of how much fun I am currently having with the solo stuff.   Very good game, would reccomend this to anyone looking for a good first person shooter.   10/10",1,bought activision publisher sale must say quite deal one could say would cheaper get used ps copy gamestop something extent could case since sale brand new copy cant scratch lose full mod support free multiplayer zombies maps world war thats pretty hard beat far gameplay goes quite possibly best cod game made even better pc nothing beats experience able play p max graphic settings nice pair headphones campaign great zombies course awesome multiplayer yet delve much fun currently solo stuff good game would reccomend anyone looking good first person shooter

" PROS:  + 2 different WW2 fronts + variety of weapons and scenarios + co-op campaign + zombie modes + mod support + still strong playerbase   CONS:  - occasional graphical bugs &amp; glitches - AI issues in certain places - some problems with connecting to other players - meeting hackers   Comment:  This game is fantastic. No need to build up tension when a game this good is reviewed. By no means is it a perfect game but surely a very good WW2 FPS worth taking a look at. People who love WW2 shooters and war stories will get their fair share of epic scenes and combat. The variety is what shines, the fact that the missions don't get repetitive. This is thanks to 2 main campaign paths, one in the Pacific and the other in Europe (east front). Yes, we have seen some scenarios in previous CoD or MoH games. But it matters little because it takes a different take on these which keeps it fresh. It has some flaws, like AI being weird in a couple of places, or the occasional glitch. But overall the campaign is great and what makes it even better is the co-op option. That being said it is not always easy to connect to your friends. Same can be said for multiplayer in general but even though the game is old the playerbase remains quite steady. This might be partially because this is (so far) the last WW2 CoD game and mod support was still a thing here. To top off the posibilities this is the first time we get zombie modes in CoD. And it's glorious, especially custom zombies. Playing these modes with friends is loads of fun! I recommend this game and I advise you to get some mods after you finish with the base experience.   P.S.:  ignore the play time, I played a ton of this back in the day but I don't own a CD/DVD drive anymore so I bought it again on Steam to try it out",1,pros different ww fronts variety weapons scenarios coop campaign zombie modes mod support still strong playerbase cons occasional graphical bugs amp glitches ai issues certain places problems connecting players meeting hackers comment game fantastic need build tension game good reviewed means perfect game surely good ww fps worth taking look people love ww shooters war stories get fair share epic scenes combat variety shines fact missions dont get repetitive thanks main campaign paths one pacific europe east front yes seen scenarios previous cod moh games matters little takes different take keeps fresh flaws like ai weird couple places occasional glitch overall campaign great makes even better coop option said always easy connect friends said multiplayer general even though game old playerbase remains quite steady might partially far last ww cod game mod support still thing top posibilities first time get zombie modes cod glorious especially custom zombies playing modes friends loads fun recommend game advise get mods finish base experience ps ignore play time played ton back day dont cddvd drive anymore bought steam try

"Arguably the best Call of Duty game of all time, and it's right to be called that. Call of Duty: World at War is a first person World War II based game. Its single player campaign is amazing and rewarding, and its multiplayer is satisfying and challenging. This game was the first of the Call of Duty series to introduce its Zombies game mode, and it's still very fun to play. People also have modded servers, so there can be some crazy stuff going on in both Zombies and Multiplayer. Also, there is a co-op campaign, so you can play with three other people if you'd like. I'm going to go through each section of this game, and explain what each one has to offer. I hope this review helps!  The campaign of this game is one of the best of the Call of Duty series. There are two stories to complete, and you complete each of the soldier's missions as you progress through the game. You play as both American soldier Private Miller, and a Russian soldier named Dimitri. Each one has their different perspectives from the war, as when you fight as Miller, you'll be going up against Japanese Imperial Soldiers, and as Dimitri, you'll be fighting against German Nazi soldiers. Each story has their different goal, but you will still be fighting for the greater good of each side. The campaign is well written, and each mission is challenging and fun. The campaign, as stated before, can be played with three other people, so if you wish to play the campaign with your friends, you can! This is, in my opinion, the best part of the campaign.   The multiplayer game mode is the same as other Call of Duty games. You can choose what game mode you want play, and search for a server to play with other people. However, I like the fact that in this PC port of Call of Duty: World at War, you can choose what server you want to go on. This allows you to choose between regular servers, and modded ones. It's obvious that the modded ones will be more popular, and it makes sense, as the modded servers allow people to vote for the next map, get an increased EXP boost, and an extended amount of time for each map, usually ranging between thirty to forty-five mintues at a time. I would almost rather be on a modded server so you can get those EXP boosts so that you can get the weapons and perks that you really want. Speaking of, the weapons in this game are very different from one another, and they all take different approaches for combats. While the bolt action snipers may all be same in approach to combat, they have a similarity with all other weapons in multiplayer: they don't come down to how good they are, but rather how much you like them. This is an amazing part of the game, as it doesn't force you to use a bad weapon the entire time, but it gives you a selection of weapons to see which one you like the most. You can also experiment with different perks, to see which ones give you the better advantage to what playstyle you're going for. I should also add this: for people who are coming from the Xbox 360, then you're in luck. There are NO hackers on this version of Call of Duty: World at War, which is the best part of this port. The multiplayer is great, and there are no hackers to speak of, and you can actually play the game without worrying about hackers.  Finally, we have the Zombies game mode. Obviously from its name, you will be fighting zombies. There are different maps to choose from, exactly four of them. But, each one are totally different from one another, and you'll need a good understand of the maps themselves if you wish to survive. Zombies is also a cooperative gamemode, so it'll only be better for you if you search for three other people to play it with. Obviously, there are modded game servers, and these servers are very fun to play on. While playing on this gamemode while being invincible is fun, it is nice to play it without mods to get the true zombies experience. There's not a lot to say about this game mode other than it's fun to play, and challenging when going into later rounds.  In conclusion, I strongly recommend this game. It's fun to play with friends, and it's still active despite its age. It's one of my personal favorites, and I think that everyone who enjoys World War II games or first person shooter games should play this game. If I were to rate this game out of ten, I would give it a strong 8/10. What keeps it from being a 9 or higher is that the multiplayer does get repetitive, but only if you play it a lot. And there will be times where you're just not feeling in the mood to be playing this game. Other than that, this game is amazing, and I hope this review helps.",1,arguably best call duty game time right called call duty world war first person world war ii based game single player campaign amazing rewarding multiplayer satisfying challenging game first call duty series introduce zombies game mode still fun play people also modded servers crazy stuff going zombies multiplayer also coop campaign play three people youd like im going go section game explain one offer hope review helps campaign game one best call duty series two stories complete complete soldiers missions progress game play american soldier private miller russian soldier named dimitri one different perspectives war fight miller youll going japanese imperial soldiers dimitri youll fighting german nazi soldiers story different goal still fighting greater good side campaign well written mission challenging fun campaign stated played three people wish play campaign friends opinion best part campaign multiplayer game mode call duty games choose game mode want play search server play people however like fact pc port call duty world war choose server want go allows choose regular servers modded ones obvious modded ones popular makes sense modded servers allow people vote next map get increased exp boost extended amount time map usually ranging thirty fortyfive mintues time would almost rather modded server get exp boosts get weapons perks really want speaking weapons game different one another take different approaches combats bolt action snipers may approach combat similarity weapons multiplayer dont come good rather much like amazing part game doesnt force use bad weapon entire time gives selection weapons see one like also experiment different perks see ones give better advantage playstyle youre going also add people coming xbox youre luck hackers version call duty world war best part port multiplayer great hackers speak actually play game without worrying hackers finally zombies game mode obviously name fighting zombies different maps choose exactly four one totally different one another youll need good understand maps wish survive zombies also cooperative gamemode itll better search three people play obviously modded game servers servers fun play playing gamemode invincible fun nice play without mods get true zombies experience theres lot say game mode fun play challenging going later rounds conclusion strongly recommend game fun play friends still active despite age one personal favorites think everyone enjoys world war ii games first person shooter games play game rate game ten would give strong keeps higher multiplayer get repetitive play lot times youre feeling mood playing game game amazing hope review helps

"World at War is one of the best games in the Call of Duty franchise. Even though I don't have much play time on the PC version I have plenty of play time of it on Xbox. Most likely you don't need to read a review to know if you want to buy World at War, but the game still seems solid even 7 years later. On console it is pretty hacked and unplayable whereas on PC there are still some good servers if you're looking to play multiplayer. I think the main reason to buy this game though is for the custom zombies since many people still play that and its very fun to just download maps and try them out. Still however, If you're going to get this game I would wait for a sale for like 50% off I don't think it’s worth the full price right now lolz..
